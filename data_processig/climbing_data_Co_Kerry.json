Indirect Route 50m M This route follows a line of least resistance, rather like a \"question mark\" up the main slab, starting at an easy fault a few metres R of 'Skome' and finishing at the top L of the crag, just R of 'Dance on a Volcano'. Geologists Hammer 30m S Start: on the main face, about 4m L of the triangular recess capped by an overhang. Climb easily and directly up to meet the crack running up from the L end of the overhang. Move up this, pull up and climb a shallow groove L of a corner to the top. Scare 35m HS Start: in the triangular recess. Follow the L side of the recess to join 'Geologists Hammer' at the L end of the overhang. Move up and traverse R across the base of the slab above the overhangto reach arete. Step up and swing onto arete from L using good pockets and flakes (exposed). Follow arete and crack to the top."

Naoi Méar, HS, 14m Climb follows series of cracks that go under two rocky arêtes situated near the top. Stand on grassy ledges to put in very bad gear and some 'crucial' micros. ==An tEarrach There== The crag is visible about 500m away on the left. It's roughly half an hour from the car. Located at the slope leading to the crag is an abandoned house with a wooden roof frame. There are two tiers to the crag. ===Lower Tier=== The following routes are located on the lower tier, which is characterised by being footed by some massive fallen blocks and a large square patch of ivy on its left hand side. Descend to the right (looking out from the top of the&nbsp;crag). Crann Pianmhar, VD, 6m Up large crack, stand on horizontal break and move left before topping out. There is a tiny stone wall coming from the centre of the crag to a boulder at its base. The first route starts left of this wall, the rest&nbsp;from the right. Tús Nua, E2 5c, 12m The obvious crack in the centre of the crag, offering brilliant climbing. Start below a hanging groove and head straight up, following the crack through overhangs. Continue to the top using the crack on&nbsp;the blunt arete. Sustained, steep, technical&nbsp;and well protected. An Balla Beag, HVS 5a, 12m Essentially a direct start to Cuimilt.&nbsp;Carefully cross over the small wall into the hole below&nbsp;the steep groove. Climb the groove&nbsp;until it's possible to swing around to the slab on the right. Continue straight up and follow cracks leftwards&nbsp;to the top. Cuimilt, VS 4c, 10m Start above the hole with the blackthorn tree, using the big&nbsp;boulder&nbsp;to get established in the hand crack (or by starting up the wall if you don't mind the hole below the crag). Take the left trending line along the cracks. An Tine, E2 5b, 12m This route starts on the right side of the crag. Access the base by climbing through a small cave from the right end of the crag. The line is the obvious thin crack that starts down in a deep hole. Try to avoid stepping back behind you to save your arms. It lets up eventually. ===Alphonse Wall=== This is the upper tier with many vertical cracks seen when topping out the lower tier. Named after a rescued lamb. Climbs are listed left to right as seen in the topo below. Mo Chéad Uair, HS, 8m Climb up leftmost ramp with your feet, keeping hands in right crack. Head upwards at end of crack. Tarrtháil Alphonse, VS 4c, 10m Crack starts above big flare in middle of wall. Climb up crack with good gear and veer right when crack splits.

Camping is not allowed at the headland. Climbers are asked to respect these guidelines so as to maintain positive relations and ensure continued climbing at Dunshean Head. Routes: Routes are described Right to Left as you face the crag. About 20m E of the rampline of Peter Pan there is a small alcove with an obvious rockfall scar. Three routes are recorded here, although only one is really worth doing. Don't Bother 10m Severe Climb the rockfall scar, exiting rightwards at the top to avoid loose rock. Added to the topo more as a warning than a recommendation! Belaid 10m V. Diff Climb the corner to the left of the rockfall. Scrappy, best avoided. EASTERN ARETE 13m HS 4c A worthwhile little route. Climb the left hand side of the arête that forms the left side of the alcove. Tricky to start Ó BUN GO BARR 12m V. Diff R. Creagh (solo), 22/06/11 Start around the corner from Peter Pan. This route takes the obvious line of right facing flakes with a large ledge at half height. CRONINS CORNER 14m S Start right of Peter Pan, climb the slab to the quartz line and ledge, and straight up from here to the flat area on the top. Protection is poor. PETER PAN 16m V.Diff P. Kelliher, T. Macken, 4.84 Climb the wide ramp that goes right side of the platform travelling diagonally left. MONKEY NUTS 18m S Start at base of crack half way between Peter Pan and Nutella. Follow this, and at about half way up tend left through the small \"V\" so as to finish as for Nutella. Small nuts useful. NUTELLA 20m HS Tony Barry, Darine West 06/06/05 Start at base of Openers and follow small crack tending right to finish on good holds finishing 1m left and above of Peter Pan top UNNAMED 20m HS 4b Daryl O' Toole Climb the line between Nutella and Openers to the top of the arrowhead (small wires) and continue to the top of the car sized pillar above. OPENERS 19m MS M. Barry, T. Macken, 4.84 To the left side of the semi-circular rock platform and to the right of the overhanging chimney climb the crack on good holds to the top. A BIRD NEVER FLEW ON ONE WING 22m HS 4b Climb the groove right of Thievery, gained by starting up Thievery or Openers. A direct start was climbed on 12/09/10 (B. Hall, D. Dineen) taking an eliminate (but nice) line up the blank looking groove between the chimney and Openers. It goes at about HVS 5a. THIEVERY 22m HS A. Devlin, P. Quinn, 4.84 Climb the overhanging chimney left of Openers. Good protection. STRANGE MEETING 20m VS 4c E. Cooper, C. Torrans, 4.85 Climb the blunt arete right of Banana Split. BANANA SPLIT 27m VS 4c T.Macken, M.Barry, 5.84 Start: The route is marked half way up by a V-shaped grove, its right hand side continues on to join the arête. Climb from directly below the V over a bulge to a small platform. Step out and climb the V, continuing right to join the arête. PANACHE 22m HS M. Barry, P.Quinn, 4.84 Climb the corner 1m left of Banana Split to a large ledge. From here climb the overhang. COCOMOTION 25m E1 5b F.A. Denis Tangney (SOLO) July '94 Climb arete and slab just right of \"Deliverance\" and left of \"Panache\". Excellent slab climb with poor protection. DELIVERANCE 27m VS 4c M. Barry, A. Devlin, 4.84 Start: 2m left of Banana Split. Climb the left diagonal crack to beneath the overhang. Turn the overhang by traversing right around it. Continue upwards at the side of the overhang to the top. HOT CHOCOLATE 27m E1 5b Start as for Deliverence.Instead of following diagonal crack of Deliverance take a straight line to the top. GRAND LARCENY 30m HVS 5a Climb the arête between Fada Amach and Deliverance. FADA AMACH 33m E2 5c M. Barry, P. Quinn, 7.84 To the left of Deliverance on the main wall climb the corner that overhangs at three-quarters height (crux), continue, following the obvious line on good holds to the top. Variation 33m 5a Escape right into Grand Larceny at the base of the overhang. The wall left of Fada Amach gives the following extreme routes: UISCE BEATHA 33m? E3/4 6a Start in the middle of the rock pool under the main wall. Move up to the first crystal horizontal break (good protection) on small side pulls. That's the hardest move on the route. Climb directly to the next double break and arrange gear for the next few metres where the bold climbing moves from a small crack (rp's and small gear) rightwards into Fada Amach for 2m just below the major undercling. Climb left and finish as for Broad Street. BROAD STREET 33m E4 6a E. Cooper, C. Torrans, M. Barry, 4.85 Start: Just left of a shallow rock pool under the main wall. Climb directly up to the horizontal break and traverse right until its possible to climb up to a short flaky crack (good runner placement). From the flake move up and left to the groove and poor protection (crux). Move left to a quartzy pocket and up the wall above moving slightly right to finish a deceptive groove. HEARTBEAT CITY 30m E3 5c Denis Tangney, Tony Macken May '95 Start 3M left of \"Broad Street\". Climb straight up to horizontal break (poor protection). Climb over bulging flake and straight up yellow lichen wall to good holds. Traverse right to obvious shallow corner and straight up to finish. GARDEN OF EARTHLY DELIGHTS 30m E4 6a/b F.A. Aidan Forde, Denis Tangney Sept. '95 Start as for \"Heartbeat City\". Climb diagonally right to reach horizontal break under small roof. Climb up to overlap and continue past two bolts (crux). Finish up faint groove as for \"Broad Street\". ECHO BEACH 33m E2 5b E. Cooper, C. Torrans, 4.85 Enjoyable climbing, though not overly protected! Start: Below the obvious bulge about 20ft up the wall. Climb the wall trending slightly leftward to the bulge which is climbed on its left side. Move right and up (poorly protected), and continue easily up a slanting groove above. FLASHFORWARD 33m HS First Ascent unknown At the left hand side of the main face, climb a small ramp to a huge ledge, then climb the arete to finish at the same corner system as Flashback. The exposure makes the route (and the grade). Moving along the platform to the left, go as far as possible towards the needle. Turn right around the corner and there is an alcove with a wall running out of it to the back of the needle. The following routes are either in the alcove or on the wall running from it. Some of these routes are quite long and so care should be taken in selecting enough gear for protection and belaying. FLASHBACK 33m S A. Devlin, (solo) , 4.84 Facing the alcove climb the right hand wall by a large open corner system and a series of rock ledges, then climb the arête to finish. (Little or no protection). A.C.S. 40m E1 5a A. Forde, T. Farell Climb the corner right of Uncle Alister. On the main wall there are two obvious crack lines. The left hand crack is Giraffe. Uncle Alister and Aunt Hanna both start in the right crack. UNCLE ALISTER 40m HVS 5a M. Barry, T. Hacken, 8.85 Climb the right hand crack with the large recess. The quality of the rock gets poorer near the top. AUNT HANNA 40m E1 5b M. Barry, A. Devlin, 10.85 Start: Climb Uncle Alister to the recess. Hand traverse left for 2m to a large pocket. From here climb directly upwards, following a series of small vertical cracks. COISCÉIM 40m HVS 5a Climb Giraffe for about 10m to the first of 2 roofs. From here make a meaty traverse right and up along a juggy crack to reach the upper crack of Uncle Alister. Finish up this route. GIRAFFE 40m VS 4c M. Barry, T. Macken, 6.84 Start: At the base of the alcove there is a crack slanting to the left that runs to the top through a number of overhangs. The top half of the route above the second overhang, while looking vegetated, is actually quite clear and offers easier climbing than does the lower half. The following routes are reached by abseiling to the base of the Needle: THRILLER 40m E3 6a Located on the arête left of Giraffe and right of Stinky Phoo. Start as for Stinky Phoo on a good ledge. Facing out to sea make a long reach for a horizontal break on the arête and swing out on to wall. From here take a straight line to the top (35m). Superb climbing on small holds. STINKY PHOO 40m HVS 5b M. Barry, T. Macken, 11.84 Start: To the right of where the needle and the main wall meet the is an obvious corner. Climb down to a small ledge to start or if the sea is in swell use the abseil rope to pendulum onto the climb missing out the first 3m. Follow the crack to the top. Joe Reville, Barry Denton, John Duignan. Start: Start from where The Needle and the main wall meet. Move across to the left onto the arete. Climb the arete - the gear is sparse and small. Exposure is airy and thrilling. After 30 m the arete and wall is covered in a dense deep carpet of lime green Ramalina lichen. Move horizontal to the right on a thin ledge, for about 10 m to the crack of Stinky Phoo - some hand holds can be found among the lichen. Climb the last 10 m of Stinky Phoo to the top. GOOD TIMES 40m VS 4c P. Quinn, M. Barry, 7.84 Start: Abseil to where the needle and the main wall meet. Move down the small chimney to reach a small inlet. Facing the main wall climb the overhanging chimney to the left to exit on a large platform (belay). From here climb the arête (loose) to finish. ARCH CYNIC 30m E2 5c F.A., Mike Barry Climb the crackline to the left of Goodtimes and directly opposite the Needle. ==THE NEEDLE== Access to the needle can be either by abseiling down the main wall at the back of the needle and then traversing around on to the East side, or by going for a swim (!) to set up a fixed rope between the alcove and a large spur on the Needle - very useful for ferrying over and back gear, and aquaphobic climbers. JUMBO 25m E1 5b A. Devlin, M. Barry, 4.84 Start: Two cracks can be seen in the Needle while facing it standing in the alcove. Follow the right hand crack as far as the quartz line, then traverse left to continue up a narrow crack to reach the spur for a hanging belay (use of the old in situ sling is not recommended). Abseil from here to descend. JUMBO variation HVS 5a If you go to the south side of the sea stack and climb the right hand crack that start's about 1 metre from the ground and trend right till you meet the route jumbo. THE RAZOR'S EDGE 30m VS 4c M. Barry, P. Quinn, T. Macken, 7.84 The route follows the sharp spectacularly exposed arête on the West side of the Needle. Start: Move along the South wall on a small ledge to the base of the arête. Belay here, or climb the short wall to a small platform and belay from there to reduce rope drag. Climb from the platform diagonally rightward to gain the arête. Climb this to the top. Beware of loose rock near the summit. The small spires further out from the Needle present some nice boulder problems where, if you do come off, you only go for a swim."

Continue upwards at the side of the overhang to the top. HOT CHOCOLATE 27m E1 5b Start as for Deliverence.Instead of following diagonal crack of Deliverance take a straight line to the top. GRAND LARCENY 30m HVS 5a Climb the arête between Fada Amach and Deliverance. FADA AMACH 33m E2 5c M. Barry, P. Quinn, 7.84 To the left of Deliverance on the main wall climb the corner that overhangs at three-quarters height (crux), continue, following the obvious line on good holds to the top. Variation 33m 5a Escape right into Grand Larceny at the base of the overhang. The wall left of Fada Amach gives the following extreme routes: UISCE BEATHA 33m? E3/4 6a Start in the middle of the rock pool under the main wall. Move up to the first crystal horizontal break (good protection) on small side pulls. That's the hardest move on the route. Climb directly to the next double break and arrange gear for the next few metres where the bold climbing moves from a small crack (rp's and small gear) rightwards into Fada Amach for 2m just below the major undercling. Climb left and finish as for Broad Street. BROAD STREET 33m E4 6a E. Cooper, C. Torrans, M. Barry, 4.85 Start: Just left of a shallow rock pool under the main wall. Climb directly up to the horizontal break and traverse right until its possible to climb up to a short flaky crack (good runner placement). From the flake move up and left to the groove and poor protection (crux). Move left to a quartzy pocket and up the wall above moving slightly right to finish a deceptive groove. HEARTBEAT CITY 30m E3 5c Denis Tangney, Tony Macken May '95 Start 3M left of \"Broad Street\". Climb straight up to horizontal break (poor protection). Climb over bulging flake and straight up yellow lichen wall to good holds. Traverse right to obvious shallow corner and straight up to finish. GARDEN OF EARTHLY DELIGHTS 30m E4 6a/b F.A. Aidan Forde, Denis Tangney Sept. '95 Start as for \"Heartbeat City\". Climb diagonally right to reach horizontal break under small roof. Climb up to overlap and continue past two bolts (crux). Finish up faint groove as for \"Broad Street\". ECHO BEACH 33m E2 5b E. Cooper, C. Torrans, 4.85 Enjoyable climbing, though not overly protected! Start: Below the obvious bulge about 20ft up the wall. Climb the wall trending slightly leftward to the bulge which is climbed on its left side. Move right and up (poorly protected), and continue easily up a slanting groove above. FLASHFORWARD 33m HS First Ascent unknown At the left hand side of the main face, climb a small ramp to a huge ledge, then climb the arete to finish at the same corner system as Flashback. The exposure makes the route (and the grade). Moving along the platform to the left, go as far as possible towards the needle. Turn right around the corner and there is an alcove with a wall running out of it to the back of the needle. The following routes are either in the alcove or on the wall running from it. Some of these routes are quite long and so care should be taken in selecting enough gear for protection and belaying. FLASHBACK 33m S A. Devlin, (solo) , 4.84 Facing the alcove climb the right hand wall by a large open corner system and a series of rock ledges, then climb the arête to finish. (Little or no protection). A.C.S. 40m E1 5a A. Forde, T. Farell Climb the corner right of Uncle Alister. On the main wall there are two obvious crack lines. The left hand crack is Giraffe. Uncle Alister and Aunt Hanna both start in the right crack. UNCLE ALISTER 40m HVS 5a M. Barry, T. Hacken, 8.85 Climb the right hand crack with the large recess. The quality of the rock gets poorer near the top. AUNT HANNA 40m E1 5b M. Barry, A. Devlin, 10.85 Start: Climb Uncle Alister to the recess. Hand traverse left for 2m to a large pocket. From here climb directly upwards, following a series of small vertical cracks. COISCÉIM 40m HVS 5a Climb Giraffe for about 10m to the first of 2 roofs. From here make a meaty traverse right and up along a juggy crack to reach the upper crack of Uncle Alister. Finish up this route. GIRAFFE 40m VS 4c M. Barry, T. Macken, 6.84 Start: At the base of the alcove there is a crack slanting to the left that runs to the top through a number of overhangs. The top half of the route above the second overhang, while looking vegetated, is actually quite clear and offers easier climbing than does the lower half. The following routes are reached by abseiling to the base of the Needle: THRILLER 40m E3 6a Located on the arête left of Giraffe and right of Stinky Phoo. Start as for Stinky Phoo on a good ledge. Facing out to sea make a long reach for a horizontal break on the arête and swing out on to wall. From here take a straight line to the top (35m). Superb climbing on small holds. STINKY PHOO 40m HVS 5b M. Barry, T. Macken, 11.84 Start: To the right of where the needle and the main wall meet the is an obvious corner. Climb down to a small ledge to start or if the sea is in swell use the abseil rope to pendulum onto the climb missing out the first 3m. Follow the crack to the top. Joe Reville, Barry Denton, John Duignan. Start: Start from where The Needle and the main wall meet. Move across to the left onto the arete. Climb the arete - the gear is sparse and small. Exposure is airy and thrilling. After 30 m the arete and wall is covered in a dense deep carpet of lime green Ramalina lichen. Move horizontal to the right on a thin ledge, for about 10 m to the crack of Stinky Phoo - some hand holds can be found among the lichen. Climb the last 10 m of Stinky Phoo to the top. GOOD TIMES 40m VS 4c P. Quinn, M. Barry, 7.84 Start: Abseil to where the needle and the main wall meet. Move down the small chimney to reach a small inlet. Facing the main wall climb the overhanging chimney to the left to exit on a large platform (belay). From here climb the arête (loose) to finish. ARCH CYNIC 30m E2 5c F.A., Mike Barry Climb the crackline to the left of Goodtimes and directly opposite the Needle. ==THE NEEDLE== Access to the needle can be either by abseiling down the main wall at the back of the needle and then traversing around on to the East side, or by going for a swim (!) to set up a fixed rope between the alcove and a large spur on the Needle - very useful for ferrying over and back gear, and aquaphobic climbers. JUMBO 25m E1 5b A. Devlin, M. Barry, 4.84 Start: Two cracks can be seen in the Needle while facing it standing in the alcove. Follow the right hand crack as far as the quartz line, then traverse left to continue up a narrow crack to reach the spur for a hanging belay (use of the old in situ sling is not recommended). Abseil from here to descend. JUMBO variation HVS 5a If you go to the south side of the sea stack and climb the right hand crack that start's about 1 metre from the ground and trend right till you meet the route jumbo. THE RAZOR'S EDGE 30m VS 4c M. Barry, P. Quinn, T. Macken, 7.84 The route follows the sharp spectacularly exposed arête on the West side of the Needle. Start: Move along the South wall on a small ledge to the base of the arête. Belay here, or climb the short wall to a small platform and belay from there to reduce rope drag. Climb from the platform diagonally rightward to gain the arête. Climb this to the top. Beware of loose rock near the summit. The small spires further out from the Needle present some nice boulder problems where, if you do come off, you only go for a swim."

Small nuts useful. NUTELLA 20m HS Tony Barry, Darine West 06/06/05 Start at base of Openers and follow small crack tending right to finish on good holds finishing 1m left and above of Peter Pan top UNNAMED 20m HS 4b Daryl O' Toole Climb the line between Nutella and Openers to the top of the arrowhead (small wires) and continue to the top of the car sized pillar above. OPENERS 19m MS M. Barry, T. Macken, 4.84 To the left side of the semi-circular rock platform and to the right of the overhanging chimney climb the crack on good holds to the top. A BIRD NEVER FLEW ON ONE WING 22m HS 4b Climb the groove right of Thievery, gained by starting up Thievery or Openers. A direct start was climbed on 12/09/10 (B. Hall, D. Dineen) taking an eliminate (but nice) line up the blank looking groove between the chimney and Openers. It goes at about HVS 5a. THIEVERY 22m HS A. Devlin, P. Quinn, 4.84 Climb the overhanging chimney left of Openers. Good protection. STRANGE MEETING 20m VS 4c E. Cooper, C. Torrans, 4.85 Climb the blunt arete right of Banana Split. BANANA SPLIT 27m VS 4c T.Macken, M.Barry, 5.84 Start: The route is marked half way up by a V-shaped grove, its right hand side continues on to join the arête. Climb from directly below the V over a bulge to a small platform. Step out and climb the V, continuing right to join the arête. PANACHE 22m HS M. Barry, P.Quinn, 4.84 Climb the corner 1m left of Banana Split to a large ledge. From here climb the overhang. COCOMOTION 25m E1 5b F.A. Denis Tangney (SOLO) July '94 Climb arete and slab just right of \"Deliverance\" and left of \"Panache\". Excellent slab climb with poor protection. DELIVERANCE 27m VS 4c M. Barry, A. Devlin, 4.84 Start: 2m left of Banana Split. Climb the left diagonal crack to beneath the overhang. Turn the overhang by traversing right around it. Continue upwards at the side of the overhang to the top. HOT CHOCOLATE 27m E1 5b Start as for Deliverence.Instead of following diagonal crack of Deliverance take a straight line to the top. GRAND LARCENY 30m HVS 5a Climb the arête between Fada Amach and Deliverance. FADA AMACH 33m E2 5c M. Barry, P. Quinn, 7.84 To the left of Deliverance on the main wall climb the corner that overhangs at three-quarters height (crux), continue, following the obvious line on good holds to the top. Variation 33m 5a Escape right into Grand Larceny at the base of the overhang. The wall left of Fada Amach gives the following extreme routes: UISCE BEATHA 33m? E3/4 6a Start in the middle of the rock pool under the main wall. Move up to the first crystal horizontal break (good protection) on small side pulls. That's the hardest move on the route. Climb directly to the next double break and arrange gear for the next few metres where the bold climbing moves from a small crack (rp's and small gear) rightwards into Fada Amach for 2m just below the major undercling. Climb left and finish as for Broad Street. BROAD STREET 33m E4 6a E. Cooper, C. Torrans, M. Barry, 4.85 Start: Just left of a shallow rock pool under the main wall. Climb directly up to the horizontal break and traverse right until its possible to climb up to a short flaky crack (good runner placement). From the flake move up and left to the groove and poor protection (crux). Move left to a quartzy pocket and up the wall above moving slightly right to finish a deceptive groove. HEARTBEAT CITY 30m E3 5c Denis Tangney, Tony Macken May '95 Start 3M left of \"Broad Street\". Climb straight up to horizontal break (poor protection). Climb over bulging flake and straight up yellow lichen wall to good holds. Traverse right to obvious shallow corner and straight up to finish. GARDEN OF EARTHLY DELIGHTS 30m E4 6a/b F.A. Aidan Forde, Denis Tangney Sept. '95 Start as for \"Heartbeat City\". Climb diagonally right to reach horizontal break under small roof. Climb up to overlap and continue past two bolts (crux). Finish up faint groove as for \"Broad Street\". ECHO BEACH 33m E2 5b E. Cooper, C. Torrans, 4.85 Enjoyable climbing, though not overly protected! Start: Below the obvious bulge about 20ft up the wall. Climb the wall trending slightly leftward to the bulge which is climbed on its left side. Move right and up (poorly protected), and continue easily up a slanting groove above. FLASHFORWARD 33m HS First Ascent unknown At the left hand side of the main face, climb a small ramp to a huge ledge, then climb the arete to finish at the same corner system as Flashback. The exposure makes the route (and the grade). Moving along the platform to the left, go as far as possible towards the needle. Turn right around the corner and there is an alcove with a wall running out of it to the back of the needle. The following routes are either in the alcove or on the wall running from it. Some of these routes are quite long and so care should be taken in selecting enough gear for protection and belaying. FLASHBACK 33m S A. Devlin, (solo) , 4.84 Facing the alcove climb the right hand wall by a large open corner system and a series of rock ledges, then climb the arête to finish. (Little or no protection). A.C.S. 40m E1 5a A. Forde, T. Farell Climb the corner right of Uncle Alister. On the main wall there are two obvious crack lines. The left hand crack is Giraffe. Uncle Alister and Aunt Hanna both start in the right crack. UNCLE ALISTER 40m HVS 5a M. Barry, T. Hacken, 8.85 Climb the right hand crack with the large recess. The quality of the rock gets poorer near the top. AUNT HANNA 40m E1 5b M. Barry, A. Devlin, 10.85 Start: Climb Uncle Alister to the recess. Hand traverse left for 2m to a large pocket. From here climb directly upwards, following a series of small vertical cracks. COISCÉIM 40m HVS 5a Climb Giraffe for about 10m to the first of 2 roofs. From here make a meaty traverse right and up along a juggy crack to reach the upper crack of Uncle Alister. Finish up this route. GIRAFFE 40m VS 4c M. Barry, T. Macken, 6.84 Start: At the base of the alcove there is a crack slanting to the left that runs to the top through a number of overhangs. The top half of the route above the second overhang, while looking vegetated, is actually quite clear and offers easier climbing than does the lower half. The following routes are reached by abseiling to the base of the Needle: THRILLER 40m E3 6a Located on the arête left of Giraffe and right of Stinky Phoo. Start as for Stinky Phoo on a good ledge. Facing out to sea make a long reach for a horizontal break on the arête and swing out on to wall. From here take a straight line to the top (35m). Superb climbing on small holds. STINKY PHOO 40m HVS 5b M. Barry, T. Macken, 11.84 Start: To the right of where the needle and the main wall meet the is an obvious corner. Climb down to a small ledge to start or if the sea is in swell use the abseil rope to pendulum onto the climb missing out the first 3m. Follow the crack to the top. Joe Reville, Barry Denton, John Duignan. Start: Start from where The Needle and the main wall meet. Move across to the left onto the arete. Climb the arete - the gear is sparse and small. Exposure is airy and thrilling. After 30 m the arete and wall is covered in a dense deep carpet of lime green Ramalina lichen. Move horizontal to the right on a thin ledge, for about 10 m to the crack of Stinky Phoo - some hand holds can be found among the lichen. Climb the last 10 m of Stinky Phoo to the top. GOOD TIMES 40m VS 4c P. Quinn, M. Barry, 7.84 Start: Abseil to where the needle and the main wall meet. Move down the small chimney to reach a small inlet. Facing the main wall climb the overhanging chimney to the left to exit on a large platform (belay). From here climb the arête (loose) to finish. ARCH CYNIC 30m E2 5c F.A., Mike Barry Climb the crackline to the left of Goodtimes and directly opposite the Needle. ==THE NEEDLE== Access to the needle can be either by abseiling down the main wall at the back of the needle and then traversing around on to the East side, or by going for a swim (!) to set up a fixed rope between the alcove and a large spur on the Needle - very useful for ferrying over and back gear, and aquaphobic climbers. JUMBO 25m E1 5b A. Devlin, M. Barry, 4.84 Start: Two cracks can be seen in the Needle while facing it standing in the alcove. Follow the right hand crack as far as the quartz line, then traverse left to continue up a narrow crack to reach the spur for a hanging belay (use of the old in situ sling is not recommended). Abseil from here to descend. JUMBO variation HVS 5a If you go to the south side of the sea stack and climb the right hand crack that start's about 1 metre from the ground and trend right till you meet the route jumbo. THE RAZOR'S EDGE 30m VS 4c M. Barry, P. Quinn, T. Macken, 7.84 The route follows the sharp spectacularly exposed arête on the West side of the Needle. Start: Move along the South wall on a small ledge to the base of the arête. Belay here, or climb the short wall to a small platform and belay from there to reduce rope drag. Climb from the platform diagonally rightward to gain the arête. Climb this to the top. Beware of loose rock near the summit. The small spires further out from the Needle present some nice boulder problems where, if you do come off, you only go for a swim."

Climb from the platform diagonally rightward to gain the arête. Climb this to the top. Beware of loose rock near the summit. The small spires further out from the Needle present some nice boulder problems where, if you do come off, you only go for a swim."

A BIRD NEVER FLEW ON ONE WING 22m HS 4b Climb the groove right of Thievery, gained by starting up Thievery or Openers. A direct start was climbed on 12/09/10 (B. Hall, D. Dineen) taking an eliminate (but nice) line up the blank looking groove between the chimney and Openers. It goes at about HVS 5a. THIEVERY 22m HS A. Devlin, P. Quinn, 4.84 Climb the overhanging chimney left of Openers. Good protection. STRANGE MEETING 20m VS 4c E. Cooper, C. Torrans, 4.85 Climb the blunt arete right of Banana Split. BANANA SPLIT 27m VS 4c T.Macken, M.Barry, 5.84 Start: The route is marked half way up by a V-shaped grove, its right hand side continues on to join the arête. Climb from directly below the V over a bulge to a small platform. Step out and climb the V, continuing right to join the arête. PANACHE 22m HS M. Barry, P.Quinn, 4.84 Climb the corner 1m left of Banana Split to a large ledge. From here climb the overhang. COCOMOTION 25m E1 5b F.A. Denis Tangney (SOLO) July '94 Climb arete and slab just right of \"Deliverance\" and left of \"Panache\". Excellent slab climb with poor protection. DELIVERANCE 27m VS 4c M. Barry, A. Devlin, 4.84 Start: 2m left of Banana Split. Climb the left diagonal crack to beneath the overhang. Turn the overhang by traversing right around it. Continue upwards at the side of the overhang to the top. HOT CHOCOLATE 27m E1 5b Start as for Deliverence.Instead of following diagonal crack of Deliverance take a straight line to the top. GRAND LARCENY 30m HVS 5a Climb the arête between Fada Amach and Deliverance. FADA AMACH 33m E2 5c M. Barry, P. Quinn, 7.84 To the left of Deliverance on the main wall climb the corner that overhangs at three-quarters height (crux), continue, following the obvious line on good holds to the top. Variation 33m 5a Escape right into Grand Larceny at the base of the overhang. The wall left of Fada Amach gives the following extreme routes: UISCE BEATHA 33m? E3/4 6a Start in the middle of the rock pool under the main wall. Move up to the first crystal horizontal break (good protection) on small side pulls. That's the hardest move on the route. Climb directly to the next double break and arrange gear for the next few metres where the bold climbing moves from a small crack (rp's and small gear) rightwards into Fada Amach for 2m just below the major undercling. Climb left and finish as for Broad Street. BROAD STREET 33m E4 6a E. Cooper, C. Torrans, M. Barry, 4.85 Start: Just left of a shallow rock pool under the main wall. Climb directly up to the horizontal break and traverse right until its possible to climb up to a short flaky crack (good runner placement). From the flake move up and left to the groove and poor protection (crux). Move left to a quartzy pocket and up the wall above moving slightly right to finish a deceptive groove. HEARTBEAT CITY 30m E3 5c Denis Tangney, Tony Macken May '95 Start 3M left of \"Broad Street\". Climb straight up to horizontal break (poor protection). Climb over bulging flake and straight up yellow lichen wall to good holds. Traverse right to obvious shallow corner and straight up to finish. GARDEN OF EARTHLY DELIGHTS 30m E4 6a/b F.A. Aidan Forde, Denis Tangney Sept. '95 Start as for \"Heartbeat City\". Climb diagonally right to reach horizontal break under small roof. Climb up to overlap and continue past two bolts (crux). Finish up faint groove as for \"Broad Street\". ECHO BEACH 33m E2 5b E. Cooper, C. Torrans, 4.85 Enjoyable climbing, though not overly protected! Start: Below the obvious bulge about 20ft up the wall. Climb the wall trending slightly leftward to the bulge which is climbed on its left side. Move right and up (poorly protected), and continue easily up a slanting groove above. FLASHFORWARD 33m HS First Ascent unknown At the left hand side of the main face, climb a small ramp to a huge ledge, then climb the arete to finish at the same corner system as Flashback. The exposure makes the route (and the grade). Moving along the platform to the left, go as far as possible towards the needle. Turn right around the corner and there is an alcove with a wall running out of it to the back of the needle. The following routes are either in the alcove or on the wall running from it. Some of these routes are quite long and so care should be taken in selecting enough gear for protection and belaying. FLASHBACK 33m S A. Devlin, (solo) , 4.84 Facing the alcove climb the right hand wall by a large open corner system and a series of rock ledges, then climb the arête to finish. (Little or no protection). A.C.S. 40m E1 5a A. Forde, T. Farell Climb the corner right of Uncle Alister. On the main wall there are two obvious crack lines. The left hand crack is Giraffe. Uncle Alister and Aunt Hanna both start in the right crack. UNCLE ALISTER 40m HVS 5a M. Barry, T. Hacken, 8.85 Climb the right hand crack with the large recess. The quality of the rock gets poorer near the top. AUNT HANNA 40m E1 5b M. Barry, A. Devlin, 10.85 Start: Climb Uncle Alister to the recess. Hand traverse left for 2m to a large pocket. From here climb directly upwards, following a series of small vertical cracks. COISCÉIM 40m HVS 5a Climb Giraffe for about 10m to the first of 2 roofs. From here make a meaty traverse right and up along a juggy crack to reach the upper crack of Uncle Alister. Finish up this route. GIRAFFE 40m VS 4c M. Barry, T. Macken, 6.84 Start: At the base of the alcove there is a crack slanting to the left that runs to the top through a number of overhangs. The top half of the route above the second overhang, while looking vegetated, is actually quite clear and offers easier climbing than does the lower half. The following routes are reached by abseiling to the base of the Needle: THRILLER 40m E3 6a Located on the arête left of Giraffe and right of Stinky Phoo. Start as for Stinky Phoo on a good ledge. Facing out to sea make a long reach for a horizontal break on the arête and swing out on to wall. From here take a straight line to the top (35m). Superb climbing on small holds. STINKY PHOO 40m HVS 5b M. Barry, T. Macken, 11.84 Start: To the right of where the needle and the main wall meet the is an obvious corner. Climb down to a small ledge to start or if the sea is in swell use the abseil rope to pendulum onto the climb missing out the first 3m. Follow the crack to the top. Joe Reville, Barry Denton, John Duignan. Start: Start from where The Needle and the main wall meet. Move across to the left onto the arete. Climb the arete - the gear is sparse and small. Exposure is airy and thrilling. After 30 m the arete and wall is covered in a dense deep carpet of lime green Ramalina lichen. Move horizontal to the right on a thin ledge, for about 10 m to the crack of Stinky Phoo - some hand holds can be found among the lichen. Climb the last 10 m of Stinky Phoo to the top. GOOD TIMES 40m VS 4c P. Quinn, M. Barry, 7.84 Start: Abseil to where the needle and the main wall meet. Move down the small chimney to reach a small inlet. Facing the main wall climb the overhanging chimney to the left to exit on a large platform (belay). From here climb the arête (loose) to finish. ARCH CYNIC 30m E2 5c F.A., Mike Barry Climb the crackline to the left of Goodtimes and directly opposite the Needle. ==THE NEEDLE== Access to the needle can be either by abseiling down the main wall at the back of the needle and then traversing around on to the East side, or by going for a swim (!) to set up a fixed rope between the alcove and a large spur on the Needle - very useful for ferrying over and back gear, and aquaphobic climbers. JUMBO 25m E1 5b A. Devlin, M. Barry, 4.84 Start: Two cracks can be seen in the Needle while facing it standing in the alcove. Follow the right hand crack as far as the quartz line, then traverse left to continue up a narrow crack to reach the spur for a hanging belay (use of the old in situ sling is not recommended). Abseil from here to descend. JUMBO variation HVS 5a If you go to the south side of the sea stack and climb the right hand crack that start's about 1 metre from the ground and trend right till you meet the route jumbo.

Torrans, 4.85 Climb the blunt arete right of Banana Split. BANANA SPLIT 27m VS 4c T.Macken, M.Barry, 5.84 Start: The route is marked half way up by a V-shaped grove, its right hand side continues on to join the arête. Climb from directly below the V over a bulge to a small platform. Step out and climb the V, continuing right to join the arête. PANACHE 22m HS M. Barry, P.Quinn, 4.84 Climb the corner 1m left of Banana Split to a large ledge. From here climb the overhang. COCOMOTION 25m E1 5b F.A. Denis Tangney (SOLO) July '94 Climb arete and slab just right of \"Deliverance\" and left of \"Panache\". Excellent slab climb with poor protection. DELIVERANCE 27m VS 4c M. Barry, A. Devlin, 4.84 Start: 2m left of Banana Split. Climb the left diagonal crack to beneath the overhang. Turn the overhang by traversing right around it. Continue upwards at the side of the overhang to the top. HOT CHOCOLATE 27m E1 5b Start as for Deliverence.Instead of following diagonal crack of Deliverance take a straight line to the top. GRAND LARCENY 30m HVS 5a Climb the arête between Fada Amach and Deliverance. FADA AMACH 33m E2 5c M. Barry, P. Quinn, 7.84 To the left of Deliverance on the main wall climb the corner that overhangs at three-quarters height (crux), continue, following the obvious line on good holds to the top. Variation 33m 5a Escape right into Grand Larceny at the base of the overhang. The wall left of Fada Amach gives the following extreme routes: UISCE BEATHA 33m? E3/4 6a Start in the middle of the rock pool under the main wall. Move up to the first crystal horizontal break (good protection) on small side pulls. That's the hardest move on the route. Climb directly to the next double break and arrange gear for the next few metres where the bold climbing moves from a small crack (rp's and small gear) rightwards into Fada Amach for 2m just below the major undercling. Climb left and finish as for Broad Street. BROAD STREET 33m E4 6a E. Cooper, C. Torrans, M. Barry, 4.85 Start: Just left of a shallow rock pool under the main wall. Climb directly up to the horizontal break and traverse right until its possible to climb up to a short flaky crack (good runner placement). From the flake move up and left to the groove and poor protection (crux). Move left to a quartzy pocket and up the wall above moving slightly right to finish a deceptive groove. HEARTBEAT CITY 30m E3 5c Denis Tangney, Tony Macken May '95 Start 3M left of \"Broad Street\". Climb straight up to horizontal break (poor protection). Climb over bulging flake and straight up yellow lichen wall to good holds. Traverse right to obvious shallow corner and straight up to finish. GARDEN OF EARTHLY DELIGHTS 30m E4 6a/b F.A. Aidan Forde, Denis Tangney Sept. '95 Start as for \"Heartbeat City\". Climb diagonally right to reach horizontal break under small roof. Climb up to overlap and continue past two bolts (crux). Finish up faint groove as for \"Broad Street\". ECHO BEACH 33m E2 5b E. Cooper, C. Torrans, 4.85 Enjoyable climbing, though not overly protected! Start: Below the obvious bulge about 20ft up the wall. Climb the wall trending slightly leftward to the bulge which is climbed on its left side. Move right and up (poorly protected), and continue easily up a slanting groove above. FLASHFORWARD 33m HS First Ascent unknown At the left hand side of the main face, climb a small ramp to a huge ledge, then climb the arete to finish at the same corner system as Flashback. The exposure makes the route (and the grade). Moving along the platform to the left, go as far as possible towards the needle. Turn right around the corner and there is an alcove with a wall running out of it to the back of the needle. The following routes are either in the alcove or on the wall running from it. Some of these routes are quite long and so care should be taken in selecting enough gear for protection and belaying. FLASHBACK 33m S A. Devlin, (solo) , 4.84 Facing the alcove climb the right hand wall by a large open corner system and a series of rock ledges, then climb the arête to finish. (Little or no protection). A.C.S. 40m E1 5a A. Forde, T. Farell Climb the corner right of Uncle Alister. On the main wall there are two obvious crack lines. The left hand crack is Giraffe. Uncle Alister and Aunt Hanna both start in the right crack. UNCLE ALISTER 40m HVS 5a M. Barry, T. Hacken, 8.85 Climb the right hand crack with the large recess. The quality of the rock gets poorer near the top. AUNT HANNA 40m E1 5b M. Barry, A. Devlin, 10.85 Start: Climb Uncle Alister to the recess. Hand traverse left for 2m to a large pocket. From here climb directly upwards, following a series of small vertical cracks. COISCÉIM 40m HVS 5a Climb Giraffe for about 10m to the first of 2 roofs. From here make a meaty traverse right and up along a juggy crack to reach the upper crack of Uncle Alister. Finish up this route. GIRAFFE 40m VS 4c M. Barry, T. Macken, 6.84 Start: At the base of the alcove there is a crack slanting to the left that runs to the top through a number of overhangs. The top half of the route above the second overhang, while looking vegetated, is actually quite clear and offers easier climbing than does the lower half. The following routes are reached by abseiling to the base of the Needle: THRILLER 40m E3 6a Located on the arête left of Giraffe and right of Stinky Phoo. Start as for Stinky Phoo on a good ledge. Facing out to sea make a long reach for a horizontal break on the arête and swing out on to wall. From here take a straight line to the top (35m). Superb climbing on small holds. STINKY PHOO 40m HVS 5b M. Barry, T. Macken, 11.84 Start: To the right of where the needle and the main wall meet the is an obvious corner. Climb down to a small ledge to start or if the sea is in swell use the abseil rope to pendulum onto the climb missing out the first 3m. Follow the crack to the top. Joe Reville, Barry Denton, John Duignan. Start: Start from where The Needle and the main wall meet. Move across to the left onto the arete. Climb the arete - the gear is sparse and small. Exposure is airy and thrilling. After 30 m the arete and wall is covered in a dense deep carpet of lime green Ramalina lichen. Move horizontal to the right on a thin ledge, for about 10 m to the crack of Stinky Phoo - some hand holds can be found among the lichen. Climb the last 10 m of Stinky Phoo to the top. GOOD TIMES 40m VS 4c P. Quinn, M. Barry, 7.84 Start: Abseil to where the needle and the main wall meet. Move down the small chimney to reach a small inlet. Facing the main wall climb the overhanging chimney to the left to exit on a large platform (belay). From here climb the arête (loose) to finish. ARCH CYNIC 30m E2 5c F.A., Mike Barry Climb the crackline to the left of Goodtimes and directly opposite the Needle. ==THE NEEDLE== Access to the needle can be either by abseiling down the main wall at the back of the needle and then traversing around on to the East side, or by going for a swim (!) to set up a fixed rope between the alcove and a large spur on the Needle - very useful for ferrying over and back gear, and aquaphobic climbers. JUMBO 25m E1 5b A. Devlin, M. Barry, 4.84 Start: Two cracks can be seen in the Needle while facing it standing in the alcove. Follow the right hand crack as far as the quartz line, then traverse left to continue up a narrow crack to reach the spur for a hanging belay (use of the old in situ sling is not recommended). Abseil from here to descend. JUMBO variation HVS 5a If you go to the south side of the sea stack and climb the right hand crack that start's about 1 metre from the ground and trend right till you meet the route jumbo. THE RAZOR'S EDGE 30m VS 4c M. Barry, P. Quinn, T. Macken, 7.84 The route follows the sharp spectacularly exposed arête on the West side of the Needle. Start: Move along the South wall on a small ledge to the base of the arête. Belay here, or climb the short wall to a small platform and belay from there to reduce rope drag. Climb from the platform diagonally rightward to gain the arête. Climb this to the top. Beware of loose rock near the summit. The small spires further out from the Needle present some nice boulder problems where, if you do come off, you only go for a swim."

HEARTBEAT CITY 30m E3 5c Denis Tangney, Tony Macken May '95 Start 3M left of \"Broad Street\". Climb straight up to horizontal break (poor protection). Climb over bulging flake and straight up yellow lichen wall to good holds. Traverse right to obvious shallow corner and straight up to finish. GARDEN OF EARTHLY DELIGHTS 30m E4 6a/b F.A. Aidan Forde, Denis Tangney Sept. '95 Start as for \"Heartbeat City\". Climb diagonally right to reach horizontal break under small roof. Climb up to overlap and continue past two bolts (crux). Finish up faint groove as for \"Broad Street\". ECHO BEACH 33m E2 5b E. Cooper, C. Torrans, 4.85 Enjoyable climbing, though not overly protected! Start: Below the obvious bulge about 20ft up the wall. Climb the wall trending slightly leftward to the bulge which is climbed on its left side. Move right and up (poorly protected), and continue easily up a slanting groove above. FLASHFORWARD 33m HS First Ascent unknown At the left hand side of the main face, climb a small ramp to a huge ledge, then climb the arete to finish at the same corner system as Flashback. The exposure makes the route (and the grade). Moving along the platform to the left, go as far as possible towards the needle. Turn right around the corner and there is an alcove with a wall running out of it to the back of the needle. The following routes are either in the alcove or on the wall running from it. Some of these routes are quite long and so care should be taken in selecting enough gear for protection and belaying. FLASHBACK 33m S A. Devlin, (solo) , 4.84 Facing the alcove climb the right hand wall by a large open corner system and a series of rock ledges, then climb the arête to finish. (Little or no protection). A.C.S. 40m E1 5a A. Forde, T. Farell Climb the corner right of Uncle Alister. On the main wall there are two obvious crack lines. The left hand crack is Giraffe. Uncle Alister and Aunt Hanna both start in the right crack. UNCLE ALISTER 40m HVS 5a M. Barry, T. Hacken, 8.85 Climb the right hand crack with the large recess. The quality of the rock gets poorer near the top. AUNT HANNA 40m E1 5b M. Barry, A. Devlin, 10.85 Start: Climb Uncle Alister to the recess. Hand traverse left for 2m to a large pocket. From here climb directly upwards, following a series of small vertical cracks. COISCÉIM 40m HVS 5a Climb Giraffe for about 10m to the first of 2 roofs. From here make a meaty traverse right and up along a juggy crack to reach the upper crack of Uncle Alister. Finish up this route. GIRAFFE 40m VS 4c M. Barry, T. Macken, 6.84 Start: At the base of the alcove there is a crack slanting to the left that runs to the top through a number of overhangs. The top half of the route above the second overhang, while looking vegetated, is actually quite clear and offers easier climbing than does the lower half. The following routes are reached by abseiling to the base of the Needle: THRILLER 40m E3 6a Located on the arête left of Giraffe and right of Stinky Phoo. Start as for Stinky Phoo on a good ledge. Facing out to sea make a long reach for a horizontal break on the arête and swing out on to wall. From here take a straight line to the top (35m). Superb climbing on small holds. STINKY PHOO 40m HVS 5b M. Barry, T. Macken, 11.84 Start: To the right of where the needle and the main wall meet the is an obvious corner. Climb down to a small ledge to start or if the sea is in swell use the abseil rope to pendulum onto the climb missing out the first 3m. Follow the crack to the top. Joe Reville, Barry Denton, John Duignan. Start: Start from where The Needle and the main wall meet. Move across to the left onto the arete. Climb the arete - the gear is sparse and small. Exposure is airy and thrilling. After 30 m the arete and wall is covered in a dense deep carpet of lime green Ramalina lichen. Move horizontal to the right on a thin ledge, for about 10 m to the crack of Stinky Phoo - some hand holds can be found among the lichen. Climb the last 10 m of Stinky Phoo to the top. GOOD TIMES 40m VS 4c P. Quinn, M. Barry, 7.84 Start: Abseil to where the needle and the main wall meet. Move down the small chimney to reach a small inlet. Facing the main wall climb the overhanging chimney to the left to exit on a large platform (belay). From here climb the arête (loose) to finish. ARCH CYNIC 30m E2 5c F.A., Mike Barry Climb the crackline to the left of Goodtimes and directly opposite the Needle. ==THE NEEDLE== Access to the needle can be either by abseiling down the main wall at the back of the needle and then traversing around on to the East side, or by going for a swim (!) to set up a fixed rope between the alcove and a large spur on the Needle - very useful for ferrying over and back gear, and aquaphobic climbers. JUMBO 25m E1 5b A. Devlin, M. Barry, 4.84 Start: Two cracks can be seen in the Needle while facing it standing in the alcove. Follow the right hand crack as far as the quartz line, then traverse left to continue up a narrow crack to reach the spur for a hanging belay (use of the old in situ sling is not recommended). Abseil from here to descend. JUMBO variation HVS 5a If you go to the south side of the sea stack and climb the right hand crack that start's about 1 metre from the ground and trend right till you meet the route jumbo. THE RAZOR'S EDGE 30m VS 4c M. Barry, P. Quinn, T. Macken, 7.84 The route follows the sharp spectacularly exposed arête on the West side of the Needle. Start: Move along the South wall on a small ledge to the base of the arête. Belay here, or climb the short wall to a small platform and belay from there to reduce rope drag. Climb from the platform diagonally rightward to gain the arête. Climb this to the top. Beware of loose rock near the summit. The small spires further out from the Needle present some nice boulder problems where, if you do come off, you only go for a swim."

Variation 33m 5a Escape right into Grand Larceny at the base of the overhang. The wall left of Fada Amach gives the following extreme routes: UISCE BEATHA 33m? E3/4 6a Start in the middle of the rock pool under the main wall. Move up to the first crystal horizontal break (good protection) on small side pulls. That's the hardest move on the route. Climb directly to the next double break and arrange gear for the next few metres where the bold climbing moves from a small crack (rp's and small gear) rightwards into Fada Amach for 2m just below the major undercling. Climb left and finish as for Broad Street. BROAD STREET 33m E4 6a E. Cooper, C. Torrans, M. Barry, 4.85 Start: Just left of a shallow rock pool under the main wall. Climb directly up to the horizontal break and traverse right until its possible to climb up to a short flaky crack (good runner placement). From the flake move up and left to the groove and poor protection (crux). Move left to a quartzy pocket and up the wall above moving slightly right to finish a deceptive groove. HEARTBEAT CITY 30m E3 5c Denis Tangney, Tony Macken May '95 Start 3M left of \"Broad Street\". Climb straight up to horizontal break (poor protection). Climb over bulging flake and straight up yellow lichen wall to good holds. Traverse right to obvious shallow corner and straight up to finish. GARDEN OF EARTHLY DELIGHTS 30m E4 6a/b F.A. Aidan Forde, Denis Tangney Sept. '95 Start as for \"Heartbeat City\". Climb diagonally right to reach horizontal break under small roof. Climb up to overlap and continue past two bolts (crux). Finish up faint groove as for \"Broad Street\". ECHO BEACH 33m E2 5b E. Cooper, C. Torrans, 4.85 Enjoyable climbing, though not overly protected! Start: Below the obvious bulge about 20ft up the wall. Climb the wall trending slightly leftward to the bulge which is climbed on its left side. Move right and up (poorly protected), and continue easily up a slanting groove above. FLASHFORWARD 33m HS First Ascent unknown At the left hand side of the main face, climb a small ramp to a huge ledge, then climb the arete to finish at the same corner system as Flashback. The exposure makes the route (and the grade). Moving along the platform to the left, go as far as possible towards the needle. Turn right around the corner and there is an alcove with a wall running out of it to the back of the needle. The following routes are either in the alcove or on the wall running from it. Some of these routes are quite long and so care should be taken in selecting enough gear for protection and belaying. FLASHBACK 33m S A. Devlin, (solo) , 4.84 Facing the alcove climb the right hand wall by a large open corner system and a series of rock ledges, then climb the arête to finish. (Little or no protection). A.C.S. 40m E1 5a A. Forde, T. Farell Climb the corner right of Uncle Alister. On the main wall there are two obvious crack lines. The left hand crack is Giraffe. Uncle Alister and Aunt Hanna both start in the right crack. UNCLE ALISTER 40m HVS 5a M. Barry, T. Hacken, 8.85 Climb the right hand crack with the large recess. The quality of the rock gets poorer near the top. AUNT HANNA 40m E1 5b M. Barry, A. Devlin, 10.85 Start: Climb Uncle Alister to the recess. Hand traverse left for 2m to a large pocket. From here climb directly upwards, following a series of small vertical cracks. COISCÉIM 40m HVS 5a Climb Giraffe for about 10m to the first of 2 roofs. From here make a meaty traverse right and up along a juggy crack to reach the upper crack of Uncle Alister. Finish up this route. GIRAFFE 40m VS 4c M. Barry, T. Macken, 6.84 Start: At the base of the alcove there is a crack slanting to the left that runs to the top through a number of overhangs. The top half of the route above the second overhang, while looking vegetated, is actually quite clear and offers easier climbing than does the lower half. The following routes are reached by abseiling to the base of the Needle: THRILLER 40m E3 6a Located on the arête left of Giraffe and right of Stinky Phoo. Start as for Stinky Phoo on a good ledge. Facing out to sea make a long reach for a horizontal break on the arête and swing out on to wall. From here take a straight line to the top (35m). Superb climbing on small holds. STINKY PHOO 40m HVS 5b M. Barry, T. Macken, 11.84 Start: To the right of where the needle and the main wall meet the is an obvious corner. Climb down to a small ledge to start or if the sea is in swell use the abseil rope to pendulum onto the climb missing out the first 3m. Follow the crack to the top. Joe Reville, Barry Denton, John Duignan. Start: Start from where The Needle and the main wall meet. Move across to the left onto the arete. Climb the arete - the gear is sparse and small. Exposure is airy and thrilling. After 30 m the arete and wall is covered in a dense deep carpet of lime green Ramalina lichen. Move horizontal to the right on a thin ledge, for about 10 m to the crack of Stinky Phoo - some hand holds can be found among the lichen. Climb the last 10 m of Stinky Phoo to the top. GOOD TIMES 40m VS 4c P. Quinn, M. Barry, 7.84 Start: Abseil to where the needle and the main wall meet. Move down the small chimney to reach a small inlet. Facing the main wall climb the overhanging chimney to the left to exit on a large platform (belay). From here climb the arête (loose) to finish.

STINKY PHOO 40m HVS 5b M. Barry, T. Macken, 11.84 Start: To the right of where the needle and the main wall meet the is an obvious corner. Climb down to a small ledge to start or if the sea is in swell use the abseil rope to pendulum onto the climb missing out the first 3m. Follow the crack to the top. Joe Reville, Barry Denton, John Duignan. Start: Start from where The Needle and the main wall meet. Move across to the left onto the arete. Climb the arete - the gear is sparse and small. Exposure is airy and thrilling. After 30 m the arete and wall is covered in a dense deep carpet of lime green Ramalina lichen. Move horizontal to the right on a thin ledge, for about 10 m to the crack of Stinky Phoo - some hand holds can be found among the lichen. Climb the last 10 m of Stinky Phoo to the top. GOOD TIMES 40m VS 4c P. Quinn, M. Barry, 7.84 Start: Abseil to where the needle and the main wall meet. Move down the small chimney to reach a small inlet. Facing the main wall climb the overhanging chimney to the left to exit on a large platform (belay). From here climb the arête (loose) to finish. ARCH CYNIC 30m E2 5c F.A., Mike Barry Climb the crackline to the left of Goodtimes and directly opposite the Needle. ==THE NEEDLE== Access to the needle can be either by abseiling down the main wall at the back of the needle and then traversing around on to the East side, or by going for a swim (!) to set up a fixed rope between the alcove and a large spur on the Needle - very useful for ferrying over and back gear, and aquaphobic climbers. JUMBO 25m E1 5b A. Devlin, M. Barry, 4.84 Start: Two cracks can be seen in the Needle while facing it standing in the alcove. Follow the right hand crack as far as the quartz line, then traverse left to continue up a narrow crack to reach the spur for a hanging belay (use of the old in situ sling is not recommended). Abseil from here to descend. JUMBO variation HVS 5a If you go to the south side of the sea stack and climb the right hand crack that start's about 1 metre from the ground and trend right till you meet the route jumbo. THE RAZOR'S EDGE 30m VS 4c M. Barry, P. Quinn, T. Macken, 7.84 The route follows the sharp spectacularly exposed arête on the West side of the Needle. Start: Move along the South wall on a small ledge to the base of the arête. Belay here, or climb the short wall to a small platform and belay from there to reduce rope drag. Climb from the platform diagonally rightward to gain the arête. Climb this to the top. Beware of loose rock near the summit. The small spires further out from the Needle present some nice boulder problems where, if you do come off, you only go for a swim."

Climb directly up to the horizontal break and traverse right until its possible to climb up to a short flaky crack (good runner placement). From the flake move up and left to the groove and poor protection (crux). Move left to a quartzy pocket and up the wall above moving slightly right to finish a deceptive groove. HEARTBEAT CITY 30m E3 5c Denis Tangney, Tony Macken May '95 Start 3M left of \"Broad Street\". Climb straight up to horizontal break (poor protection). Climb over bulging flake and straight up yellow lichen wall to good holds. Traverse right to obvious shallow corner and straight up to finish. GARDEN OF EARTHLY DELIGHTS 30m E4 6a/b F.A. Aidan Forde, Denis Tangney Sept. '95 Start as for \"Heartbeat City\". Climb diagonally right to reach horizontal break under small roof. Climb up to overlap and continue past two bolts (crux).

            "description": "First Ascent unknown At the left hand side of the main face, climb a small ramp to a huge ledge, then climb the arete to finish at the same corner system as Flashback. The exposure makes the route (and the grade). Moving along the platform to the left, go as far as possible towards the needle. Turn right around the corner and there is an alcove with a wall running out of it to the back of the needle. The following routes are either in the alcove or on the wall running from it. Some of these routes are quite long and so care should be taken in selecting enough gear for protection and belaying. FLASHBACK 33m S A. Devlin, (solo) , 4.84 Facing the alcove climb the right hand wall by a large open corner system and a series of rock ledges, then climb the arête to finish. (Little or no protection). A.C.S. 40m E1 5a A. Forde, T. Farell Climb the corner right of Uncle Alister. On the main wall there are two obvious crack lines. The left hand crack is Giraffe. Uncle Alister and Aunt Hanna both start in the right crack. UNCLE ALISTER 40m HVS 5a M. Barry, T. Hacken, 8.85 Climb the right hand crack with the large recess. The quality of the rock gets poorer near the top. AUNT HANNA 40m E1 5b M. Barry, A. Devlin, 10.85 Start: Climb Uncle Alister to the recess. Hand traverse left for 2m to a large pocket. From here climb directly upwards, following a series of small vertical cracks. COISCÉIM 40m HVS 5a Climb Giraffe for about 10m to the first of 2 roofs. From here make a meaty traverse right and up along a juggy crack to reach the upper crack of Uncle Alister. Finish up this route. GIRAFFE 40m VS 4c M. Barry, T. Macken, 6.84 Start: At the base of the alcove there is a crack slanting to the left that runs to the top through a number of overhangs. The top half of the route above the second overhang, while looking vegetated, is actually quite clear and offers easier climbing than does the lower half. The following routes are reached by abseiling to the base of the Needle: THRILLER 40m E3 6a Located on the arête left of Giraffe and right of Stinky Phoo. Start as for Stinky Phoo on a good ledge. Facing out to sea make a long reach for a horizontal break on the arête and swing out on to wall. From here take a straight line to the top (35m). Superb climbing on small holds. STINKY PHOO 40m HVS 5b M. Barry, T. Macken, 11.84 Start: To the right of where the needle and the main wall meet the is an obvious corner. Climb down to a small ledge to start or if the sea is in swell use the abseil rope to pendulum onto the climb missing out the first 3m. Follow the crack to the top. Joe Reville, Barry Denton, John Duignan. Start: Start from where The Needle and the main wall meet. Move across to the left onto the arete. Climb the arete - the gear is sparse and small. Exposure is airy and thrilling. After 30 m the arete and wall is covered in a dense deep carpet of lime green Ramalina lichen. Move horizontal to the right on a thin ledge, for about 10 m to the crack of Stinky Phoo - some hand holds can be found among the lichen. Climb the last 10 m of Stinky Phoo to the top. GOOD TIMES 40m VS 4c P. Quinn, M. Barry, 7.84 Start: Abseil to where the needle and the main wall meet. Move down the small chimney to reach a small inlet. Facing the main wall climb the overhanging chimney to the left to exit on a large platform (belay). From here climb the arête (loose) to finish. ARCH CYNIC 30m E2 5c F.A., Mike Barry Climb the crackline to the left of Goodtimes and directly opposite the Needle. ==THE NEEDLE== Access to the needle can be either by abseiling down the main wall at the back of the needle and then traversing around on to the East side, or by going for a swim (!) to set up a fixed rope between the alcove and a large spur on the Needle - very useful for ferrying over and back gear, and aquaphobic climbers. JUMBO 25m E1 5b A. Devlin, M. Barry, 4.84 Start: Two cracks can be seen in the Needle while facing it standing in the alcove. Follow the right hand crack as far as the quartz line, then traverse left to continue up a narrow crack to reach the spur for a hanging belay (use of the old in situ sling is not recommended). Abseil from here to descend. JUMBO variation HVS 5a If you go to the south side of the sea stack and climb the right hand crack that start's about 1 metre from the ground and trend right till you meet the route jumbo. THE RAZOR'S EDGE 30m VS 4c M. Barry, P. Quinn, T. Macken, 7.84 The route follows the sharp spectacularly exposed arête on the West side of the Needle. Start: Move along the South wall on a small ledge to the base of the arête. Belay here, or climb the short wall to a small platform and belay from there to reduce rope drag. Climb from the platform diagonally rightward to gain the arête. Climb this to the top. Beware of loose rock near the summit. The small spires further out from the Needle present some nice boulder problems where, if you do come off, you only go for a swim."

            "description": "M. Barry, T. Macken, 6.84 Start: At the base of the alcove there is a crack slanting to the left that runs to the top through a number of overhangs. The top half of the route above the second overhang, while looking vegetated, is actually quite clear and offers easier climbing than does the lower half. The following routes are reached by abseiling to the base of the Needle: THRILLER 40m E3 6a Located on the arête left of Giraffe and right of Stinky Phoo. Start as for Stinky Phoo on a good ledge. Facing out to sea make a long reach for a horizontal break on the arête and swing out on to wall. From here take a straight line to the top (35m). Superb climbing on small holds. STINKY PHOO 40m HVS 5b M. Barry, T. Macken, 11.84 Start: To the right of where the needle and the main wall meet the is an obvious corner. Climb down to a small ledge to start or if the sea is in swell use the abseil rope to pendulum onto the climb missing out the first 3m. Follow the crack to the top. Joe Reville, Barry Denton, John Duignan. Start: Start from where The Needle and the main wall meet. Move across to the left onto the arete. Climb the arete - the gear is sparse and small. Exposure is airy and thrilling. After 30 m the arete and wall is covered in a dense deep carpet of lime green Ramalina lichen. Move horizontal to the right on a thin ledge, for about 10 m to the crack of Stinky Phoo - some hand holds can be found among the lichen. Climb the last 10 m of Stinky Phoo to the top. GOOD TIMES 40m VS 4c P. Quinn, M. Barry, 7.84 Start: Abseil to where the needle and the main wall meet. Move down the small chimney to reach a small inlet. Facing the main wall climb the overhanging chimney to the left to exit on a large platform (belay). From here climb the arête (loose) to finish. ARCH CYNIC 30m E2 5c F.A., Mike Barry Climb the crackline to the left of Goodtimes and directly opposite the Needle. ==THE NEEDLE== Access to the needle can be either by abseiling down the main wall at the back of the needle and then traversing around on to the East side, or by going for a swim (!) to set up a fixed rope between the alcove and a large spur on the Needle - very useful for ferrying over and back gear, and aquaphobic climbers. JUMBO 25m E1 5b A. Devlin, M. Barry, 4.84 Start: Two cracks can be seen in the Needle while facing it standing in the alcove. Follow the right hand crack as far as the quartz line, then traverse left to continue up a narrow crack to reach the spur for a hanging belay (use of the old in situ sling is not recommended). Abseil from here to descend. JUMBO variation HVS 5a If you go to the south side of the sea stack and climb the right hand crack that start's about 1 metre from the ground and trend right till you meet the route jumbo. THE RAZOR'S EDGE 30m VS 4c M. Barry, P. Quinn, T. Macken, 7.84 The route follows the sharp spectacularly exposed arête on the West side of the Needle. Start: Move along the South wall on a small ledge to the base of the arête. Belay here, or climb the short wall to a small platform and belay from there to reduce rope drag. Climb from the platform diagonally rightward to gain the arête. Climb this to the top. Beware of loose rock near the summit. The small spires further out from the Needle present some nice boulder problems where, if you do come off, you only go for a swim."

            "description": "Great climbing. Takes the line up the gently overhanging arete on the left side of the tall part of the crag. Start just to the right of a grassy step. Climb up to reach a right trending crackline. Follow this crack to a footledge, arrange gear, then climb up and left on a series of slopers and crimps (bold) to where the arete kicks back and gear can be placed. Climb this to the top. == Idir linnte == Crag is so named as it lies facing a stream seperating two large pools. When facing away from the crag, the number 3 can be seen in the right hand pool. Access is from the top car park where climbers should drop down and use the wooden walkway to get as close to the rock face as possible, a detour off left and then by heading towards the prominent corner of the crag should bring climbers to the best point to start and drop gear. Routes are right to left from this corner. Abseil steaks can be used as anchors for routes on the faces either side of this corner. First obvious line left of the corner, go straight up through the middle over a horizontal break, left of the prominent flake. Avoid the temptation to escape out right and use the flake or left at the top to use the jugs (climber will be rewarded with a super positive crimp when line is maintained). Gear is sparse but good. A bold face climb of sloppers and highsteps, 3m left of Chicken and Waffles, climbs the face up through a horizontal break at 3m, last point of protection just above 5m. The top of the route is in need of some real gardening but should reveal move points of protection and lower the grade back to VS. Short and stout, this route takes the steep, jagged crackline. Climb a juggy flake to reach the right trending flared crack. A series of unlikely and unconventional moves will deposit you on the top. Only the creative need apply. == Back Wall == This is the main wall you see on top of the steep slope at the back of the upper lake. It consists of 3 rocky bands with breaks in between (mostly vegetated). Left of center you see a diagonal break tending to the right and crossing all rocky bands, this is the gully. Haul yourself up the very steep slope to the base of the rock face. From here proceed to the base of the gully. Pitch 1. Its best to set up a belay here, as a slip of the first rocky step will send you tumbling till you hit the lake. Climb up this step (Diff 5m) till you reach the second obstacle. Belay. Pitch 2. Stay to the right of a big (wet) boulder blocking your way (S 5m). Not many good positive holds and poor pro. good pro above this obstacle though. Continue to third obstacle. Belay. Pitch 3. Climb third obstacle (Vertical, very loose and very poor pro, rounded of by a hard exit move holding onto heather, HS 10m) A small bit above the exit you'll find a good belay. Pitch 4. After this its either continuing on pitched with a body belay at the top, move together or solo.... depending on your confidence level. Walk up the summit slope to bag Stradbally Mountain if you feel like it."

The top of the route is in need of some real gardening but should reveal move points of protection and lower the grade back to VS. Short and stout, this route takes the steep, jagged crackline. Climb a juggy flake to reach the right trending flared crack. A series of unlikely and unconventional moves will deposit you on the top. Only the creative need apply. == Back Wall == This is the main wall you see on top of the steep slope at the back of the upper lake. It consists of 3 rocky bands with breaks in between (mostly vegetated). Left of center you see a diagonal break tending to the right and crossing all rocky bands, this is the gully. Haul yourself up the very steep slope to the base of the rock face. From here proceed to the base of the gully. Pitch 1. Its best to set up a belay here, as a slip of the first rocky step will send you tumbling till you hit the lake. Climb up this step (Diff 5m) till you reach the second obstacle. Belay. Pitch 2. Stay to the right of a big (wet) boulder blocking your way (S 5m). Not many good positive holds and poor pro. good pro above this obstacle though. Continue to third obstacle. Belay. Pitch 3. Climb third obstacle (Vertical, very loose and very poor pro, rounded of by a hard exit move holding onto heather, HS 10m) A small bit above the exit you'll find a good belay. Pitch 4. After this its either continuing on pitched with a body belay at the top, move together or solo.... depending on your confidence level.

            "description": "R Dean belayed by J Domoney 15/6/81 A difficult start and difficulty in placing gear make this an unusual climb. Start; at the foot of a large deep chimney, The route climbs the outside of the chimney’s retaining left wall, gained by a step left from the belay and difficult moves up a steep black wall. A short move right then cracks to the top. Sanity Clause 26m VS 4b Climb the chimney immediately R of 'The Mutation'. The bottom half can be slippery. An Port ? R Dean 15/6/81 A short and elegant route up the curved arête 8 m right of the deep chiney. Short and unprotected. Start; at the foot of the arête beneath the left crack of three fine parallel cracks. The line of the arête is followed past a small break on the left to large finishing jugs. Sandman Slab 15m E1 (one aid nut) A direct line up the slab 1m L of 'An Port'. The crux is at mid-height, where an RP was used for aid. Sandman E2 5b/c Now goes free. The Pass VS 4b/c Climb the obvious layback crack L of the 'Sandman' slab. An Rinceoir 15m V.Diff P. Stronach 15/6/81 A good route with a fine line taking the biggest of three parallel cracks. Start; just right of 'An Port' by about 2 m. Climb straight up the crack using laybacks and good jugs. Continue up short arête to top on good holds. Boys Own VD/S Wall R of An Rinceoir, finishing up corner above. Luidím Maclú ? As for 'Boys Own' then move R to corner. An Clochán 15m VD T Owens T Daly 15/6/81 A pleasant layback and an exposed finish. Start; on large ledge 6 m from base of crag and in the very back of Chimney Scoop. Follow edge of obvious flake to left end of a ledge. Continue up corner above to a good stance. Wee Nick ? 5a The wall and overhang between 'An Clochán' and 'The Low Lintel'. The Low Lintel 20m S R Dean 15/6/81 A crux near the top. Start; at the sea-level ledge 4 m right of a large pulpit of rock and beneath small rightward-facing corners. Climb corners to the second quartz break then the slab above just left of a left-facing corner. Exit up ‘An Clochán’ or across the tops of ‘Deora na Maighdine’ and ‘Fliuchras’ . Sailor Boy HVS 5a/b The slabs and overhangs between 'The Low Lintel' and 'Deora na Maighdine'. Deora na Maighdine 20m S P Stronach K Higgins 15/6/81 Start; at the sea level ledge 4 m right of ‘The Low Lintel’ and below an overhanging corner. Climb up to corner on small positive holds past a large band of quartz with large crystals to a ledge. Move slightly left and up a small crack and corner to top ledge. Good protection throughout. Fliuchras 25m VS 4c P Stronach K Higgins 15/6/81 A route worth doing – looks a bit improbable, but is all there. This route takes the line straight up the middle of the protruding slab on the right hand side of Chimney Scoop. Start; from the sea-level ledge climb straight up the slab to a small overhang above the quartz vein. Climb the overhang and continue up the steeper slab above to bulge. Continue over bulge {crux} and up slab using small holds and crack. Move left on the ledge above and continue up crack to top. Protection good. Ceann Dubh 20m HS K Higgins P Stronach 15/6/81 Start; 3 m left of the right hand boundary of Chimney Scoop and beneath the protruding slab. The overhang above is split by a corner. Climb the slab and corner to the top. ===Black Wall=== Slí Amach 5m VD R Dean 15/6/81 A good way of reaching Chimney Scoop from Black Wall. Start; at the extreme left end of the sea ledge below Black Wall is a wide shallow chimney. Climb the back wall of the chimney. A short walk along the top of ‘Ceann Dubh’, ‘Fliuchras’, ‘Deora na Maighdine’ and ‘The Low Lintel’ allows a descent of the lower section of ‘An Clochán’. An Capall Glas 20m HS P O'Leary E Smith 15/6/81 An attractive line. Start; as for ‘Slí Amach’. Climb the corner that forms the left boundary of Black Wall where it meets a leaning buttress. Bogna HS/VS The groove and wall just R of 'An Capall Glas'. (Difficulties can be avoided). Swirls S The obvious line L of 'Faoi Dheire'. Wee Nuke S Wall just L of ' Faoi Dheire'. Hairy Dog S Fault line R of 'Wee Nuke'. Faoi Dheire 40m S T Daly P Stronach 17/6/81 A pleasant route making a line linking the two obvious recesses. Start; outside the first recess and climb arête on the left hand side of corner until the second recess is reached. Climb the obvious corner above this to top. The top of this climb is a little loose, as is most of the top of Black Wall. Protection pretty good. Delman S Fault line in between 'Faoi Dheire' and 'Tobar na Sidhe' Tobar na Sidhe 40m S P Stronach J Domoney 16/6/81 This route takes a line straight up from about 6 m left of ‘Scoilt Linda’ and about 3 m left of the grey-green slab on which ‘Ceathru’ runs. Start; from the main sea-level ledge. Climb up to a small overhang in wall right of a quartz vein. Continue up two parallel s-shaped cracks to top. Protection fair. Ceathru 40m S C Torrans P Stronach 18/6/81 This route takes an obvious line straight up the grey-green slab on the right -hand side of the Black Wall and just left of ‘Scoilt Linda’. Start; at the bottom of the Slab and climb it straight up it to top. Protection good. ===The Slab=== Scoilt Linda 35m VD L McGee E Smith (alt leads) 14/6/81 A Classic. Good protection in the crack. Start; at the base of the crack dividing The Slab and the Black Wall. 1. 15m Climb the crack to a good stance on a pillar in the crack. 2. 20m Climb the crack above to the top. Fiche Bliain ag Fás 35m E1 5b R Dean P Stronach J Domoney 16/6/81 Small wires and good eyesight to arrange protection. Start; below the zig-zag break. Climb this to a flake above and on the right, then delicately up the slab on small secure holds. (Good small wires.) Peig 35m HVS 5a R Dean P Stronach 18/6/81 Start; 2 m right of 'Fiche Bliain ag Fás'. The climb continues parallel to 'Fiche Bliain ag Fás' passing 2 m left of a short overhung leftward facing corner at mid height, the line of 'An t-Oileánach'. to gain a weak break above a faint overhang. Up this to deep crack and the top. An t-Oileánach 30m VS 4c P Stronach K Higgins 14/6/81 A real gem of a climb. Well protected and producing a fine position. This route runs straight up the middle of the main slab breaking through the overhanging corner which is at mid height. Start; directly below the overhanging corner. Climb a thin crack past the stepped ledge to the overhang. Climb this stepping right on the slab above. Continue up rightward-trending break above. An Béal Bocht 30m E1 5b C Torrans J Domoney 18/6/81 Scarce protection. The route is approximately 2 m left of the corner on ‘Slí na Firine’. Start; up easy slabs to small overhang. Climb this by undercuts to small edge (5a). Climb straight right wards to pale patch of rock on thin holds (5b). Move up on good small finger holds to the top. Slí na Firine 30m S K Higgins P Stronach 13/6/81 Varied with slab climbing and a corner requiring small wires for protection. Start; just left of the first corner right of the zig-zag break followed by ‘Fiche Bliain ag Fás’. The climb can easily be split into 2 pitches, the top one harder and requiring small wires for protection. Bóthar an Aimhleasa 25m S J O'Dwyer T Daly 13/6/81 The route is easily identified from the diagram and may be split into 2 pitches at the half way ledge. The top pitch is harder requiring small wires for protection. Neamhurchoideas 15m VD E Smyth P Cashin 13/6/81 A good climb breaking easily through an overhang near the top after pleasant slab and crack climbing. An Céad Faoistin 15m S R Dean 16/6/81 A short slab finished by a hard move to a good handhold. Poor protection. Mná 15m D P Maher P Oman 14/6/81 Fir 15m D V Hynes A Weber 14/6/81 Both routes provide nice climbing up twin corners at the extreme right hand side of The Slab. They may be started at sea level or at mid-height depending on the sea and the state of the tide. Ag Snámh d'Éan 70m S R Dean 18/6/81 A good traverse best started from the right. This leaves the crux of each pitch to the last. Traverse under the overhang of ‘Neamhurchoideas’ along the stepped ledge of ‘An t-Oileánach’ and across a slab (crux) onto the belay of ‘Scoilt Linda’. From here traverse past two recesses on the Black Wall to finish by a quartz break across the leaning break of ‘An Capall Glas’."

Start; from the main sea-level ledge. Climb up to a small overhang in wall right of a quartz vein. Continue up two parallel s-shaped cracks to top. Protection fair. Ceathru 40m S C Torrans P Stronach 18/6/81 This route takes an obvious line straight up the grey-green slab on the right -hand side of the Black Wall and just left of ‘Scoilt Linda’. Start; at the bottom of the Slab and climb it straight up it to top. Protection good. ===The Slab=== Scoilt Linda 35m VD L McGee E Smith (alt leads) 14/6/81 A Classic. Good protection in the crack. Start; at the base of the crack dividing The Slab and the Black Wall. 1. 15m Climb the crack to a good stance on a pillar in the crack. 2. 20m Climb the crack above to the top. Fiche Bliain ag Fás 35m E1 5b R Dean P Stronach J Domoney 16/6/81 Small wires and good eyesight to arrange protection. Start; below the zig-zag break. Climb this to a flake above and on the right, then delicately up the slab on small secure holds. (Good small wires.) Peig 35m HVS 5a R Dean P Stronach 18/6/81 Start; 2 m right of 'Fiche Bliain ag Fás'. The climb continues parallel to 'Fiche Bliain ag Fás' passing 2 m left of a short overhung leftward facing corner at mid height, the line of 'An t-Oileánach'. to gain a weak break above a faint overhang. Up this to deep crack and the top. An t-Oileánach 30m VS 4c P Stronach K Higgins 14/6/81 A real gem of a climb. Well protected and producing a fine position. This route runs straight up the middle of the main slab breaking through the overhanging corner which is at mid height. Start; directly below the overhanging corner. Climb a thin crack past the stepped ledge to the overhang. Climb this stepping right on the slab above. Continue up rightward-trending break above. An Béal Bocht 30m E1 5b C Torrans J Domoney 18/6/81 Scarce protection. The route is approximately 2 m left of the corner on ‘Slí na Firine’. Start; up easy slabs to small overhang.

Slí na Firine 30m S K Higgins P Stronach 13/6/81 Varied with slab climbing and a corner requiring small wires for protection. Start; just left of the first corner right of the zig-zag break followed by ‘Fiche Bliain ag Fás’.

MAIN ARETE AREA The first ascent claim is contested: Renowned Irish climber Mike Barry claims to have climbed this in the ‘80s. <nowiki>https://www.pressreader.com/ireland/sunday-indep</nowiki> It should be noted that the claim was made in good faith, as records are scarce. Yer only man* E1 5b Approach Take the coast road to Ferriters Cove. After passing the golf course continue along the road to reach the highest house on the hill from where a short section of track leads to a grassy parking area on the right. Even from a long distance away, the top of the ridge which the route takes is visible as a rocky knoll some 300m to the left of the obvious lookout tower. From the parking follow tracks uphill until it is possible to contour left to this point. (20 minutes) Tale a breather on the the grassy slopes opposite where the whole route is now visible (deep breath!).  PS.The farmers are very friendly, smile and say hello, and obviously, don’t damage their fences. General Sybil Head is one of the most spectacular coastal features in Ireland. This climb takes the massive stepped ridge that projects dramatically into the ocean.  The route is extremely long and exposed and should not be attempted in bad weather, particularly if high winds are forecast. Access to and escape from the ridge is complicated and rescue in the event of injury would be very difficult. Take spare clothes, food and a head torch. It should be obvious from your first sight of the ridge that this is a route for competent parties.  The rock is an incredibly knobbly conglomerate which is generally solid. However, it snags ropes very, very easily - expect some delays because of this. Use long extenders and don’t be tempted to run pitches together. Runner placements are less frequent than might be expected on such featured rock. Take lots of long slings. Large hexes are also very useful.  The route does not appear to be affected by nesting birds and the approach is non tidal except in very high seas when the first pitch may be swamped. Getting to the start As you face the crag a prominent darker boulder and a series of descending grass ledges are visible. The descent starts from a twin bolt belay which is slightly lower and10m to the left of the boulder. From here descend diagonally leftwards for 45m to a second bolt belay. Continue in the same line to further bolt belays that are 22m and 20m metres further along. The last of these bolts are in a recess below a slabby wall with a grass ledge above it. Climb up to the grassy ledge (20m) and at its left end are the anchors for the abseil approach.  (Note that it is instead possible to continue the descending traverse for a further 20m to a different set of bolts. The hangers have been removed as this proved to be a 70m free hanging abseil that led to a dead end)  Abseil into the chimney and aim for the slab wall on the left. On the first ascent a 100m static rope was used which was left in situ as a precaution. It was subsequently retrieved during the ascent. It should be possible to complete the descent using shorter ropes by finding an intermediate belay and either abseiling again or down climbing. The angle eases towards the base of the slab and it becomes possible to scramble leftwards (facing in) to arrive at a shallow gully which leads down around the corner to a belay at the foot of a large corner crack. This is nearly the most seaward point of the ridge. If you manage all this in less than an hour you have done well. The climb starts here. The route 1. 35m (4b) Climb up and around the corner crack to arrive at a good ledge 2. 20m Either climb the chimney or pass it on the outside to gain another niche stance 3. 20m Traverse left from the stance to reach a knife edge section and then follow easy black ledges on the North side to a belay 4. 30m (4a) Climb the chimney to the large chockstone then move steeply left (obvious thread) and regain the crest which is followed to the next break in the ridge pitches). mix. ledge. this belays. 5. 40m Follow the ridge as it descends to arrive at a foot of another wall. 6. 35m (4a) Climb the wall up and slightly rightwards to gain a short chimney which leads to the entry abseil station. (if an ab rope has been left in situretrieve it and carry it for the rest of the route, don’t drag it, it will snag) 7. 15m Climb above the belay and traverse rightwards along the crest to a cave. Pass the pinnacle on the North side or over the top if it’s not too windy to reach a thread belay. 8. 20m Follow the ridge to a huge flake belay 9. 30m (4c) Climb above the belay keeping to the left of the chimney. A steep move leads to big holds and the flake crack above. From here move slightly left and up to gain the ridge again. Not much gear on this pitch. 10. 10m Follow the ridge easily to another belay with a thread low down to the left. ( An escape to the grass gully on the left may be possible here reducing the overall grade to HVS but this then omits the final 4 pitches). 11. 25m (5b) The route now throws a boulder problem into the mix. Overcome the blunt nose which has a good cam slot to gain a ledge. Climb past the spongey recess on it’s left to reach the ridge. Along this for a short distance to thread and spike belays. The ridge rears fiercely above this point. There are number of steep direct options but these would probably be significantly harder than all that has gone before and are not in keeping with the route. Therefore….. 12. 40m Descend easy slabs on the right side of the ridge, crossing over a little subsidiary ridge to arrive at the foot of an obvious chimney on the left 13. 15m Climb the chimney  14. 50m Follow the solid and delightfully easy slabs to the top of the ridge  Walk off from here. You’re done! The first 6 pitches of the climb were previously ascended on 22 August but gales and heavy rain forced a retreat from the abseil point used on the approach. However, these pitches include the most spectacular rock scenery on the route and are worthy of a route name in their own right. Escape at the end of pitch 6 would be by reversing the line of approach Yer Little Man* VS 4bl 180m, 6 pitches. This route consists of the first 6 pitches of Yer Only Man and ends at the abseil point used top access the main route. Escape is then by reversing the approach. It provides an easier option than the whole ridge, covers some of the best ground and is very worthwhile in its own right."

On the first ascent a 100m static rope was used which was left in situ as a precaution. It was subsequently retrieved during the ascent. It should be possible to complete the descent using shorter ropes by finding an intermediate belay and either abseiling again or down climbing. The angle eases towards the base of the slab and it becomes possible to scramble leftwards (facing in) to arrive at a shallow gully which leads down around the corner to a belay at the foot of a large corner crack. This is nearly the most seaward point of the ridge. If you manage all this in less than an hour you have done well. The climb starts here. The route 1. 35m (4b) Climb up and around the corner crack to arrive at a good ledge 2. 20m Either climb the chimney or pass it on the outside to gain another niche stance 3. 20m Traverse left from the stance to reach a knife edge section and then follow easy black ledges on the North side to a belay 4. 30m (4a) Climb the chimney to the large chockstone then move steeply left (obvious thread) and regain the crest which is followed to the next break in the ridge pitches). mix. ledge. this belays. 5. 40m Follow the ridge as it descends to arrive at a foot of another wall. 6. 35m (4a) Climb the wall up and slightly rightwards to gain a short chimney which leads to the entry abseil station. (if an ab rope has been left in situretrieve it and carry it for the rest of the route, don’t drag it, it will snag) 7. 15m Climb above the belay and traverse rightwards along the crest to a cave. Pass the pinnacle on the North side or over the top if it’s not too windy to reach a thread belay. 8. 20m Follow the ridge to a huge flake belay 9. 30m (4c) Climb above the belay keeping to the left of the chimney. A steep move leads to big holds and the flake crack above. From here move slightly left and up to gain the ridge again. Not much gear on this pitch. 10. 10m Follow the ridge easily to another belay with a thread low down to the left. ( An escape to the grass gully on the left may be possible here reducing the overall grade to HVS but this then omits the final 4 pitches). 11. 25m (5b) The route now throws a boulder problem into the mix. Overcome the blunt nose which has a good cam slot to gain a ledge. Climb past the spongey recess on it’s left to reach the ridge. Along this for a short distance to thread and spike belays. The ridge rears fiercely above this point. There are number of steep direct options but these would probably be significantly harder than all that has gone before and are not in keeping with the route. Therefore….. 12. 40m Descend easy slabs on the right side of the ridge, crossing over a little subsidiary ridge to arrive at the foot of an obvious chimney on the left 13. 15m Climb the chimney  14. 50m Follow the solid and delightfully easy slabs to the top of the ridge  Walk off from here. You’re done! The first 6 pitches of the climb were previously ascended on 22 August but gales and heavy rain forced a retreat from the abseil point used on the approach. However, these pitches include the most spectacular rock scenery on the route and are worthy of a route name in their own right. Escape at the end of pitch 6 would be by reversing the line of approach Yer Little Man* VS 4bl 180m, 6 pitches. This route consists of the first 6 pitches of Yer Only Man and ends at the abseil point used top access the main route. Escape is then by reversing the approach. It provides an easier option than the whole ridge, covers some of the best ground and is very worthwhile in its own right."

Access. Travel through the settlement of Smerwick and continue on to the east along the boreen to its end, where it is possible to park and turn a car. Walk north to the lowest point of the cliff line, about 15 minutes. Scramble down the slab just east of a zawn and then traverse along rock pavements and rock fall debris in an easterly direction. The corner of \"Crooked Sister\" is immediately obvious in the middle of a large impending wall, just beyond a large rockfall and about 100m short of the large cave. The line of the route is obvious and is climbed in one long pitch. The final belay is in a deep cleft a few meters above and to the R of the last steep section. The rock is relatively fragile, though not loose, so use lots of protection, large to medium rocks and hexes, but save a few 8's and 9's for the extreme overhang. Friends are disappointing, especially in the lower section. The climb is steeper, and therefore, harder than it looks. Don't lose heart at the overhang. There is a 'no hands' rest immediately above and the upper section offers rough rock with good holds, jams and protection."

Give grid references and the name of the crag if possible. ==Protection== Due to the horizontal nature of many of the crack lines, small camming devices, especially those with flexible stems prove very useful in the Gap. On many of the routes Flexible Friends are the main source of protection. ==Using the Guide== The various crags are described starting on the east (left) side of the valley and working south up the Gap and then the routes on the western side of the valley are described in the same manner. Climbs on each face are described from left to right. Climbs thats are not numbered on the topos are newly added. ==Céim - East Side of the Gap== About a mile up the road from Kates, there is a path to the left which leads to the river Loe (this is the river flowing out of the Black Lake). Cross the stepping stones and follow the path up to the old house. Go straight past the house and down into a small valley where the crag is situated (100 metres from the house). Céim is very sheltered from the wind and the rain and due to the fact that it is overhanging in places some routes remain dry on wet days. GUINEVERE, THE WATERY TART 15m HVS 5b The true line that cuffs crap starts up. Instead of escaping right into the corner system with the tree stump, continue leftwards to climb the intimidating overhanging v-groove which is easier than it looks. Excellent protection. (Direct: Climb the white wall and overhang direct on positive side pulls. Bold start. E1 5b B. Hall, J. Hale) 1:CUFF'S CRAP 15m VS 4c Start under the overhanging corner on the left hand side of the crag. Climb the steps up to the corner (above the tree), finishing up the corner. 2:THE BLACK STUFF 15m HVS 5b R. Stack, I. Counihan. 21/10/90 The obvious line to the right of Cuff's Crap. Climb on good holds to a small overhang, surmount this and move slightly right, then climb over a bulge on the corner to the top 3:MOONDANCE * 15m VS 4c D. Tagney, A. Forde. 12/10/94 Start 1m right of The Black Stuff under a small white-stained overhang. Climb straight to the ledge, then up and step onto a small ledge. Move up and right to the top. VARIATION: Instead of moving right continue up the left-facing corner (VS 4c). 4:SEAN NÓS * 15m HVS 5a M Shea, C. Corrigan. Summer '90 Start under a square block (about 3m up). Climb over this and continue straight up to the ledge. Finish as for Miss Piggy. 5:THE GREAT WAR * 15m HVS/E1 5a R. Stack, G.Stack. 11/11/90 Start 1m left of the arete left of Miss Piggy. Climb to the overhang (good wire around corner on right) and straight to the top. 6:MISS PIGGY 17m VS 4c R. Stack, Rob Stack July '89 and re-climbed August '91 after removal of large blocks Climb the obvious corner (left of Titanic) to the ledge, then traverse left for 1.5m and climb the obvious crack to the top. ARACHNOPHOBIA 12m HVS 5b B. McSweeney, E. Kennedy, O. O’Regan 3/8/03 Start 0.5m (!) left of The Revolution Has Begun and go up to groove. Then onto good jug. Mantleshelf onto the crux move (crimp) and then work towards tree on horizontal cracks. Break onto arete. Poor gear on top section but good at bottom, mostly friends. 7:THE REVOLUTION HAS BEGUN 12m HVS 5a/E1 5b D. O’Toole 27/10/01 Boulder start off the horizontal crack. Reach diagonally up left to a horizontal hold, then straight to top via good crimps. Protection is small aliens and red HB offset brassie, all good. 8:TITANIC ** 12m VS 4b Short but steep. Climb the hand crack on the right hand side of the crag. 9:THE PRODIGAL SON 10m HVS 5a R. Stack, P. Costelloe. 15/9/91. Climb the thin line 2-3m to the right of Titanic. ==Bothán - East Side of the Gap== This buttress is situated directly above Black Stream Bridge on the east side of the valley. Walk 100m past the bridge to two small quarried areas on the left hand side of the road, from here head straight up to the crag. It can be quite exposed to wind, which is good if the midges are out, but bad if it‟s cold. The crag dries quickly after rain and seepage isn‟t a problem on most routes. West facing; a good spot for evening sunshine. LEFT BUTTRESS APRIL SUNSHINE 15m M S Start about 3m left of \"The Ego Has Landed\", climbing the left corner of the lower face, proceed up the middle of the second section, getting behind the holly tree. Good holds, but poor protection. 1:THE EGO HAS LANDED 15m VS 4c A.Forde, I.Counihan. 15/9/90 Arete above a large ledge on the extreme left of the buttress. Protection is sparse. 2:FIRST COME FIRST SERVED * 15m VS 4b T. Long, D. Mulcahy. 6/4/95 Climb the line between The Ego Has Landed and Agent Orange. Climb directly up to the crackline and continue straight up to the top. 3:AGENT ORANGE 15m HS 4b I.Counihan, A.Forde. 15/9/90 Large crack and corner on the left hand side of the buttress. FULCRUM 20m HVS 5a R. Stack, C. Cudden, A. Forde 15/5/93 This route is between 3 and 4. Climb up to a ledge (overhanging) and then up the left side of the face above to another ledge. Continue up existing over a small overhang at the top. 4:PRIVATE INVESTIGATIONS * 20m VS 4c C. Moriarty, M. Shea. August '86 Climb up left of the overhang to gain a ledge. From the ledge step right and climb up to another ledge. Veer left at the blank face and climb over a small overhang near the top. 5:LJUBLJANA ** 20m E1 5c R. Stack, B. Forde. 3/8/91 Start to the right of Private Investigations, climb the face onto the ledge, climb over the obvious protruding spike and then over the overhang and continue straight to the top. 6:DISCO LEGS ** 20m E3 5c P. Hoy 4/9/99 (climbed past crux previously but was unclaimed) Between B5 and B6, straight to roof, pocket, sidepull (not the loose one on the left), direct to top past sloping breaks. Finish up the crack of Raven. Pumpy but protection is good. 7:RAVEN ** 20m VS 4b This climb is on the right hand side of the buttress. Climb through the obvious breech in the overhang to a small quartz vein, traverse left and ascend the crack. Protection is poor at the start. A variation is to traverse half way across and climb over the small overhang (5a). 8:BUGLER 20m VS 4b Start as for Raven but continue straight to the top (over a holly bush). Protection is poor at the start. 9:FIACH DUBH 15m VS 4c R. Creagh, D.Dineen. 02/05/10. Start as for Raven. Standing on the first ledge arrange gear in the crack, then step out right onto the face gaining good holds. Go straight to the top from here, keeping left of a small bush and going past a short slab and through the overhang at 3/4 height. Beware of loose rock. 10:RESPECT 15m HVS 5a B. O’Dwyer, E. Lawless 21/4/00 Start just to the right of the arete to the right of Bugler. A poorly protected dynamic move over the bulge (long reach helps). Tend leftwards along the obvious line to the top. 11:ADRIAN'S ROUTE 12m VS 4c This route is on the far right of the buttress 3-4m around the corner from Bugler. Climb the faint overhanging corner, move right and climb straight to the top. The most difficult moves are at the start where the protection is poorest. 12:BACK OR BRAIN 6m VS 4b I. Counihan, R. Stack. 14/4/91 Start 2-3m to the right of Adrian's Route. Start on a small ledge right of a large holly tree. Climb the obvious line veering slightly right towards the top. BERRY FUNNY 6m VDiff Start right of Back Or Brain. Climb diagonal crack to the right exiting left of holly tree. Not first ascent, first recorded. RIGHT BUTTRESS SETANTA 8m S Start on the first flat rock at the base on the chimney, left of \"Akimbo\". Climb the right hand wall of the chimney, using the good hand and footholds, climbing slightly left to the highest point of the face. Protection is poor. 13:AKIMBO * 7m HS 4b/c J. Behal, C. Cudden 13/9/95 Climb the arete left of The Hobbit. Poor protection at the start. 14:THE HOBBIT 6m HS 4b R. Stack, B. Forde. 3/8/91 Climb the slightly overhanging crack left of the obvious corner (which contains a tree.) 15:BALDY 10m VS 4c M Shea, B.Galvin Summer '90 Climb the edge of the face to the left of Spider. Protection is poor. 16:SPIDER 10m Severe Climb up the blank face on the left side of the buttress. This climb weaves back and forth. Protection is poor. 16A:CRAZY FROG 9m HVS 4c Start just left of the small holly tree midway along the base of the climbs. Climb up just left of the tree on sidepulls and undercuts. Crux. Continue directly up to the top. Protection is poor. 17:P.O.S. 8m V.Diff R. Stack, P. Cudden. Jan '89 (pile of shite?) Start about 5m to the right of Spider and climb the obvious line to the top. ==The Chimneys== The area known as The Chimneys is situated on the eastern side of the Gap of Dunloe, above Bothán crag. They are broken down into three main outcrops. The approach is as for Bothán, but continue in a north easterly direction for approx. 10 minutes and you will arrive at the crags. The approach after leaving Bothán may be difficult as the heather in high….but I think its worth the effort. There seems to be very little seepage there. HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN VS 18m Start on the left of the smaller crag at the left of the chimneys. Climb the obvious crack and stay left of the tree root. Climb straight up till you arrive at the ledge (avoid the temptation to move right on the High Hopes), instead, climb the overhanging face topping out a little higher than High Hopes. HIGH HOPES S 18m This climb is on the very left of the outcrops, at the base of the large triangular rock. Start in the very obvious corner, climbing up to the overhang, move left, climb past the bush, moving slightly right before climbing to the top of the crag. PEARLY GATES S 18m Ger Cronin/John O'Sullivan S Start as for High Hopes, but instead of going left at the overhang, climb straight up the face, topping out at the top out for High Hopes CRONINS YARD VDIFF 16m The start for this is about 50m to the right, and slightly uphill from High Hopes, Start at the left hand corner of the small crag, and climb the corner to the heathery covering. The decent is off to the left of the top out and down the small gully THE STEPS VDIFF 14m The Steps is on the left corner of the next major crag after Cronins Yard, Climb the obvious steps, finishing on the first major heathery ledge you reach. Avoid the temptation to climb further, as it makes your decent to your left very tricky MAIDEN VOYAGE MS 15m Start about 4m to the right of The Steps, climb the rock which has a concave shape, climbing straight up the flat face and topping out at the obvious crack in the rock at the top of the climb. VERTICAL LIMIT VS 46m On the crag on the southern end of the Chimneys, Start at the base of the obvious crack, climb straight up, over the small overhang, onto the ledge, from here climb straight up the blocky climb to highest point in the crag. Protection is good. Decent from here is off to the right of the crag as you face it. ==Carraig Ceannann== This is the most northerly of the cliffs on the western side of the valley. About 1 Km up the Gap turn right and walk up the Cora Road (at the \"Going Climbing\" sign). Follow this zig zag road up to the nearest point to an obvious white buttress this is lower Carraig Ceannann. A few metres up and around the corner is an obvious off-width crack, this is the line of Moloise. Further left you will come to upper Carraig Ceannann. 1:ERICA 10m V.Diff A. Forde, B. Forde. 22/4/90 Start 2m right of the mossy gully on the extreme left hand end of Carraig Ceannann, keeping a small clump of heather on your right hand side. Climb up to a right tending diagonal line, continue along this and exit on an easy right tending ramp at the top. 2:EASY ROUTE 10m Severe C. Moriarty (Solo) August '86 This climb is to the right of Erica. Climb the blank face, following no definite line. Protection is poor. 3:TAR WARS * 20m E1 5c A. Forde, B. Forde. 28/4/90 The furthest left crack through the small roof left of Cuchulainn. 1. 15m Climb the crack through the roof (crux) and belay on the grass ledge. 2. 5m Climb the wall behind and slightly right of the first pitch to finish left of the large block on top. 4:DIVING FOR PEARLS ** 25m E2 5c,5c A. Forde, R. Stack. 15/9/90 1. 15m Start at a narrow chimney 2m right of Tar Wars. Climb this past an upside down slot to another slot. Move up and left to gain the upper wall. Belay on the large ledge above. 2. 10m From the ledge gain a small corner above a rose bush, climb the upper wall on good holds to the left hand side of a large block on top. CHRISTMAS JUMPER 30m E2 5b/c R. Creagh, J. Eldred. 23/11/14 (Toproped beforehand; it was wet and looked harder!) A bit eliminate but worth a go if you've done the other routes here. Climb Cuchulainn to the holly tree. Move left and climb the wall left of the corner, passing through the overhangs using a few holds common with Cuchulainn but keeping out of the corner proper. 5:CUCHULAINN ** 30m HVS 5a C. Moriarty, A. Forde. July '84 This route follows the obvious line to the left of the main overhang. Traverse in from the left to the base of the line. Climb straight up the obvious line to an awkward overhanging niche. Continue to the large ledge (small holly tree in crack) climb straight up the overhanging corner (difficult to protect) and on to the top on good holds. CUCHULAINN-VARIATION 28m E1 5b Follow Cuchulainn to the holly bush. From here traverse right up the flat wall and continue up up to the top. 6:FERDIA ** 26m HVS 5a A. Forde, C. Moriarty. July '84 From the start of Cuchulainn climb up and right into a corner. Climb this to the overhang before breaking out right to a large ledge. Continue up the narrow chimney to the roof before turning awkwardly right again, and up into the final niche. Escape out left and up to the top. 7:FERDIA DIRECT 40m E2 5c M Shea, B. Forde. September '89 Instead of traversing from Cuchulainn to the start of Ferdia, start at the lowest point of the line. Climb the line to a small overhang (crux), Move slightly left to surmount this and then onto the original route. 8:VALHALLA 30m E1 5c I. Counihan, A. Forde. 24/4/90 The line immediately right of Ferdia."

They are broken down into three main outcrops. The approach is as for Bothán, but continue in a north easterly direction for approx. 10 minutes and you will arrive at the crags. The approach after leaving Bothán may be difficult as the heather in high….but I think its worth the effort. There seems to be very little seepage there.

VERTICAL LIMIT VS 46m On the crag on the southern end of the Chimneys, Start at the base of the obvious crack, climb straight up, over the small overhang, onto the ledge, from here climb straight up the blocky climb to highest point in the crag. Protection is good. Decent from here is off to the right of the crag as you face it. ==Carraig Ceannann== This is the most northerly of the cliffs on the western side of the valley. About 1 Km up the Gap turn right and walk up the Cora Road (at the \"Going Climbing\" sign). Follow this zig zag road up to the nearest point to an obvious white buttress this is lower Carraig Ceannann.

Walk 100m past the bridge to two small quarried areas on the left hand side of the road, from here head straight up to the crag. It can be quite exposed to wind, which is good if the midges are out, but bad if it‟s cold. The crag dries quickly after rain and seepage isn‟t a problem on most routes. West facing; a good spot for evening sunshine. LEFT BUTTRESS APRIL SUNSHINE 15m M S Start about 3m left of \"The Ego Has Landed\", climbing the left corner of the lower face, proceed up the middle of the second section, getting behind the holly tree.

Finish up the crack of Raven. Pumpy but protection is good. 7:RAVEN ** 20m VS 4b This climb is on the right hand side of the buttress. Climb through the obvious breech in the overhang to a small quartz vein, traverse left and ascend the crack. Protection is poor at the start. A variation is to traverse half way across and climb over the small overhang (5a). 8:BUGLER 20m VS 4b Start as for Raven but continue straight to the top (over a holly bush). Protection is poor at the start. 9:FIACH DUBH 15m VS 4c R. Creagh, D.Dineen. 02/05/10. Start as for Raven. Standing on the first ledge arrange gear in the crack, then step out right onto the face gaining good holds. Go straight to the top from here, keeping left of a small bush and going past a short slab and through the overhang at 3/4 height. Beware of loose rock. 10:RESPECT 15m HVS 5a B. O’Dwyer, E. Lawless 21/4/00 Start just to the right of the arete to the right of Bugler. A poorly protected dynamic move over the bulge (long reach helps). Tend leftwards along the obvious line to the top. 11:ADRIAN'S ROUTE 12m VS 4c This route is on the far right of the buttress 3-4m around the corner from Bugler. Climb the faint overhanging corner, move right and climb straight to the top. The most difficult moves are at the start where the protection is poorest. 12:BACK OR BRAIN 6m VS 4b I. Counihan, R.

Start about 5m to the right of Spider and climb the obvious line to the top. ==The Chimneys== The area known as The Chimneys is situated on the eastern side of the Gap of Dunloe, above Bothán crag. They are broken down into three main outcrops. The approach is as for Bothán, but continue in a north easterly direction for approx. 10 minutes and you will arrive at the crags. The approach after leaving Bothán may be difficult as the heather in high….but I think its worth the effort. There seems to be very little seepage there. HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN VS 18m Start on the left of the smaller crag at the left of the chimneys. Climb the obvious crack and stay left of the tree root. Climb straight up till you arrive at the ledge (avoid the temptation to move right on the High Hopes), instead, climb the overhanging face topping out a little higher than High Hopes.

Avoid the temptation to climb further, as it makes your decent to your left very tricky MAIDEN VOYAGE MS 15m Start about 4m to the right of The Steps, climb the rock which has a concave shape, climbing straight up the flat face and topping out at the obvious crack in the rock at the top of the climb. VERTICAL LIMIT VS 46m On the crag on the southern end of the Chimneys, Start at the base of the obvious crack, climb straight up, over the small overhang, onto the ledge, from here climb straight up the blocky climb to highest point in the crag. Protection is good. Decent from here is off to the right of the crag as you face it. ==Carraig Ceannann== This is the most northerly of the cliffs on the western side of the valley. About 1 Km up the Gap turn right and walk up the Cora Road (at the \"Going Climbing\" sign). Follow this zig zag road up to the nearest point to an obvious white buttress this is lower Carraig Ceannann. A few metres up and around the corner is an obvious off-width crack, this is the line of Moloise. Further left you will come to upper Carraig Ceannann. 1:ERICA 10m V.Diff A. Forde, B.

Walk 100m past the bridge to two small quarried areas on the left hand side of the road, from here head straight up to the crag. It can be quite exposed to wind, which is good if the midges are out, but bad if it‟s cold. The crag dries quickly after rain and seepage isn‟t a problem on most routes. West facing; a good spot for evening sunshine. LEFT BUTTRESS APRIL SUNSHINE 15m M S Start about 3m left of \"The Ego Has Landed\", climbing the left corner of the lower face, proceed up the middle of the second section, getting behind the holly tree.

Finish up the crack of Raven. Pumpy but protection is good. 7:RAVEN ** 20m VS 4b This climb is on the right hand side of the buttress. Climb through the obvious breech in the overhang to a small quartz vein, traverse left and ascend the crack. Protection is poor at the start. A variation is to traverse half way across and climb over the small overhang (5a). 8:BUGLER 20m VS 4b Start as for Raven but continue straight to the top (over a holly bush). Protection is poor at the start. 9:FIACH DUBH 15m VS 4c R. Creagh, D.Dineen. 02/05/10. Start as for Raven. Standing on the first ledge arrange gear in the crack, then step out right onto the face gaining good holds.

Start about 5m to the right of Spider and climb the obvious line to the top. ==The Chimneys== The area known as The Chimneys is situated on the eastern side of the Gap of Dunloe, above Bothán crag. They are broken down into three main outcrops. The approach is as for Bothán, but continue in a north easterly direction for approx. 10 minutes and you will arrive at the crags. The approach after leaving Bothán may be difficult as the heather in high….but I think its worth the effort. There seems to be very little seepage there. HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN VS 18m Start on the left of the smaller crag at the left of the chimneys. Climb the obvious crack and stay left of the tree root. Climb straight up till you arrive at the ledge (avoid the temptation to move right on the High Hopes), instead, climb the overhanging face topping out a little higher than High Hopes. HIGH HOPES S 18m This climb is on the very left of the outcrops, at the base of the large triangular rock.

The decent is off to the left of the top out and down the small gully THE STEPS VDIFF 14m The Steps is on the left corner of the next major crag after Cronins Yard, Climb the obvious steps, finishing on the first major heathery ledge you reach. Avoid the temptation to climb further, as it makes your decent to your left very tricky MAIDEN VOYAGE MS 15m Start about 4m to the right of The Steps, climb the rock which has a concave shape, climbing straight up the flat face and topping out at the obvious crack in the rock at the top of the climb. VERTICAL LIMIT VS 46m On the crag on the southern end of the Chimneys, Start at the base of the obvious crack, climb straight up, over the small overhang, onto the ledge, from here climb straight up the blocky climb to highest point in the crag. Protection is good. Decent from here is off to the right of the crag as you face it. ==Carraig Ceannann== This is the most northerly of the cliffs on the western side of the valley. About 1 Km up the Gap turn right and walk up the Cora Road (at the \"Going Climbing\" sign). Follow this zig zag road up to the nearest point to an obvious white buttress this is lower Carraig Ceannann. A few metres up and around the corner is an obvious off-width crack, this is the line of Moloise. Further left you will come to upper Carraig Ceannann. 1:ERICA 10m V.Diff A. Forde, B.

Belay on the large ledge above. 2. 10m From the ledge gain a small corner above a rose bush, climb the upper wall on good holds to the left hand side of a large block on top. CHRISTMAS JUMPER 30m E2 5b/c R. Creagh, J. Eldred. 23/11/14 (Toproped beforehand; it was wet and looked harder!) A bit eliminate but worth a go if you've done the other routes here.

They are broken down into three main outcrops. The approach is as for Bothán, but continue in a north easterly direction for approx. 10 minutes and you will arrive at the crags. The approach after leaving Bothán may be difficult as the heather in high….but I think its worth the effort. There seems to be very little seepage there. HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN VS 18m Start on the left of the smaller crag at the left of the chimneys. Climb the obvious crack and stay left of the tree root. Climb straight up till you arrive at the ledge (avoid the temptation to move right on the High Hopes), instead, climb the overhanging face topping out a little higher than High Hopes.

VERTICAL LIMIT VS 46m On the crag on the southern end of the Chimneys, Start at the base of the obvious crack, climb straight up, over the small overhang, onto the ledge, from here climb straight up the blocky climb to highest point in the crag.

Finish up the crack of Raven. Pumpy but protection is good. 7:RAVEN ** 20m VS 4b This climb is on the right hand side of the buttress. Climb through the obvious breech in the overhang to a small quartz vein, traverse left and ascend the crack. Protection is poor at the start. A variation is to traverse half way across and climb over the small overhang (5a). 8:BUGLER 20m VS 4b Start as for Raven but continue straight to the top (over a holly bush).

Start about 5m to the right of Spider and climb the obvious line to the top. ==The Chimneys== The area known as The Chimneys is situated on the eastern side of the Gap of Dunloe, above Bothán crag. They are broken down into three main outcrops. The approach is as for Bothán, but continue in a north easterly direction for approx. 10 minutes and you will arrive at the crags. The approach after leaving Bothán may be difficult as the heather in high….but I think its worth the effort. There seems to be very little seepage there. HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN VS 18m Start on the left of the smaller crag at the left of the chimneys. Climb the obvious crack and stay left of the tree root. Climb straight up till you arrive at the ledge (avoid the temptation to move right on the High Hopes), instead, climb the overhanging face topping out a little higher than High Hopes. HIGH HOPES S 18m This climb is on the very left of the outcrops, at the base of the large triangular rock. Start in the very obvious corner, climbing up to the overhang, move left, climb past the bush, moving slightly right before climbing to the top of the crag.

The decent is off to the left of the top out and down the small gully THE STEPS VDIFF 14m The Steps is on the left corner of the next major crag after Cronins Yard, Climb the obvious steps, finishing on the first major heathery ledge you reach. Avoid the temptation to climb further, as it makes your decent to your left very tricky MAIDEN VOYAGE MS 15m Start about 4m to the right of The Steps, climb the rock which has a concave shape, climbing straight up the flat face and topping out at the obvious crack in the rock at the top of the climb. VERTICAL LIMIT VS 46m On the crag on the southern end of the Chimneys, Start at the base of the obvious crack, climb straight up, over the small overhang, onto the ledge, from here climb straight up the blocky climb to highest point in the crag. Protection is good. Decent from here is off to the right of the crag as you face it. ==Carraig Ceannann== This is the most northerly of the cliffs on the western side of the valley. About 1 Km up the Gap turn right and walk up the Cora Road (at the \"Going Climbing\" sign). Follow this zig zag road up to the nearest point to an obvious white buttress this is lower Carraig Ceannann. A few metres up and around the corner is an obvious off-width crack, this is the line of Moloise. Further left you will come to upper Carraig Ceannann. 1:ERICA 10m V.Diff A. Forde, B.

Belay on the large ledge above. 2. 10m From the ledge gain a small corner above a rose bush, climb the upper wall on good holds to the left hand side of a large block on top. CHRISTMAS JUMPER 30m E2 5b/c R. Creagh, J. Eldred. 23/11/14 (Toproped beforehand; it was wet and looked harder!) A bit eliminate but worth a go if you've done the other routes here.

Climb through the obvious breech in the overhang to a small quartz vein, traverse left and ascend the crack. Protection is poor at the start. A variation is to traverse half way across and climb over the small overhang (5a). 8:BUGLER 20m VS 4b Start as for Raven but continue straight to the top (over a holly bush).

Start about 5m to the right of Spider and climb the obvious line to the top. ==The Chimneys== The area known as The Chimneys is situated on the eastern side of the Gap of Dunloe, above Bothán crag. They are broken down into three main outcrops. The approach is as for Bothán, but continue in a north easterly direction for approx. 10 minutes and you will arrive at the crags. The approach after leaving Bothán may be difficult as the heather in high….but I think its worth the effort. There seems to be very little seepage there. HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN VS 18m Start on the left of the smaller crag at the left of the chimneys. Climb the obvious crack and stay left of the tree root. Climb straight up till you arrive at the ledge (avoid the temptation to move right on the High Hopes), instead, climb the overhanging face topping out a little higher than High Hopes.

Avoid the temptation to climb further, as it makes your decent to your left very tricky MAIDEN VOYAGE MS 15m Start about 4m to the right of The Steps, climb the rock which has a concave shape, climbing straight up the flat face and topping out at the obvious crack in the rock at the top of the climb. VERTICAL LIMIT VS 46m On the crag on the southern end of the Chimneys, Start at the base of the obvious crack, climb straight up, over the small overhang, onto the ledge, from here climb straight up the blocky climb to highest point in the crag. Protection is good. Decent from here is off to the right of the crag as you face it. ==Carraig Ceannann== This is the most northerly of the cliffs on the western side of the valley. About 1 Km up the Gap turn right and walk up the Cora Road (at the \"Going Climbing\" sign). Follow this zig zag road up to the nearest point to an obvious white buttress this is lower Carraig Ceannann. A few metres up and around the corner is an obvious off-width crack, this is the line of Moloise. Further left you will come to upper Carraig Ceannann. 1:ERICA 10m V.Diff A. Forde, B.

They are broken down into three main outcrops. The approach is as for Bothán, but continue in a north easterly direction for approx. 10 minutes and you will arrive at the crags. The approach after leaving Bothán may be difficult as the heather in high….but I think its worth the effort. There seems to be very little seepage there.

The approach after leaving Bothán may be difficult as the heather in high….but I think its worth the effort. There seems to be very little seepage there. HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN VS 18m Start on the left of the smaller crag at the left of the chimneys. Climb the obvious crack and stay left of the tree root. Climb straight up till you arrive at the ledge (avoid the temptation to move right on the High Hopes), instead, climb the overhanging face topping out a little higher than High Hopes.

Avoid the temptation to climb further, as it makes your decent to your left very tricky MAIDEN VOYAGE MS 15m Start about 4m to the right of The Steps, climb the rock which has a concave shape, climbing straight up the flat face and topping out at the obvious crack in the rock at the top of the climb. VERTICAL LIMIT VS 46m On the crag on the southern end of the Chimneys, Start at the base of the obvious crack, climb straight up, over the small overhang, onto the ledge, from here climb straight up the blocky climb to highest point in the crag.

Start about 5m to the right of Spider and climb the obvious line to the top. ==The Chimneys== The area known as The Chimneys is situated on the eastern side of the Gap of Dunloe, above Bothán crag. They are broken down into three main outcrops. The approach is as for Bothán, but continue in a north easterly direction for approx. 10 minutes and you will arrive at the crags. The approach after leaving Bothán may be difficult as the heather in high….but I think its worth the effort. There seems to be very little seepage there. HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN VS 18m Start on the left of the smaller crag at the left of the chimneys. Climb the obvious crack and stay left of the tree root. Climb straight up till you arrive at the ledge (avoid the temptation to move right on the High Hopes), instead, climb the overhanging face topping out a little higher than High Hopes. HIGH HOPES S 18m This climb is on the very left of the outcrops, at the base of the large triangular rock.

Avoid the temptation to climb further, as it makes your decent to your left very tricky MAIDEN VOYAGE MS 15m Start about 4m to the right of The Steps, climb the rock which has a concave shape, climbing straight up the flat face and topping out at the obvious crack in the rock at the top of the climb. VERTICAL LIMIT VS 46m On the crag on the southern end of the Chimneys, Start at the base of the obvious crack, climb straight up, over the small overhang, onto the ledge, from here climb straight up the blocky climb to highest point in the crag. Protection is good. Decent from here is off to the right of the crag as you face it. ==Carraig Ceannann== This is the most northerly of the cliffs on the western side of the valley.

E1 Extremely Severe 5a,5b,5c E2 5b,5c,6a E3 etc. 5c,6a,6b etc It should be noted that many of the routes have not had second ascents, these have a '1' after the route name. The accepted star grading system is used with three stars being reserved for the routes of highest quality. Again the star grading system is suggestive rather than definitive and newer routes in particular may be deserving of more or fewer stars than indicated. An absence of stars does not mean that a route is not worth doing. Where there was some dispute over the grade, two grades were given e.g. HVS/E1 5b/5c. This means that route is most likely HVS 5b but possibly E1 5c. Also if there was some doubt over the technical grade an alternative grade is put in brackets. e.g. E2 5c(6a). ==Mountain Rescue== In the event of an accident, where assistance is required, dial 112 and ask for Mountain Rescue. The nearest telephone is at Kate Kearneys Cottage. Give grid references and the name of the crag if possible. ==Protection== Due to the horizontal nature of many of the crack lines, small camming devices, especially those with flexible stems prove very useful in the Gap. On many of the routes Flexible Friends are the main source of protection. ==Using the Guide== The various crags are described starting on the east (left) side of the valley and working south up the Gap and then the routes on the western side of the valley are described in the same manner. Climbs on each face are described from left to right. Climbs thats are not numbered on the topos are newly added. ==Céim - East Side of the Gap== About a mile up the road from Kates, there is a path to the left which leads to the river Loe (this is the river flowing out of the Black Lake). Cross the stepping stones and follow the path up to the old house. Go straight past the house and down into a small valley where the crag is situated (100 metres from the house). Céim is very sheltered from the wind and the rain and due to the fact that it is overhanging in places some routes remain dry on wet days. GUINEVERE, THE WATERY TART 15m HVS 5b The true line that cuffs crap starts up. Instead of escaping right into the corner system with the tree stump, continue leftwards to climb the intimidating overhanging v-groove which is easier than it looks. Excellent protection. (Direct: Climb the white wall and overhang direct on positive side pulls. Bold start. E1 5b B. Hall, J. Hale) 1:CUFF'S CRAP 15m VS 4c Start under the overhanging corner on the left hand side of the crag. Climb the steps up to the corner (above the tree), finishing up the corner. 2:THE BLACK STUFF 15m HVS 5b R. Stack, I. Counihan. 21/10/90 The obvious line to the right of Cuff's Crap. Climb on good holds to a small overhang, surmount this and move slightly right, then climb over a bulge on the corner to the top 3:MOONDANCE * 15m VS 4c D. Tagney, A. Forde. 12/10/94 Start 1m right of The Black Stuff under a small white-stained overhang. Climb straight to the ledge, then up and step onto a small ledge. Move up and right to the top. VARIATION: Instead of moving right continue up the left-facing corner (VS 4c). 4:SEAN NÓS * 15m HVS 5a M Shea, C. Corrigan. Summer '90 Start under a square block (about 3m up). Climb over this and continue straight up to the ledge. Finish as for Miss Piggy. 5:THE GREAT WAR * 15m HVS/E1 5a R. Stack, G.Stack. 11/11/90 Start 1m left of the arete left of Miss Piggy. Climb to the overhang (good wire around corner on right) and straight to the top. 6:MISS PIGGY 17m VS 4c R. Stack, Rob Stack July '89 and re-climbed August '91 after removal of large blocks Climb the obvious corner (left of Titanic) to the ledge, then traverse left for 1.5m and climb the obvious crack to the top. ARACHNOPHOBIA 12m HVS 5b B. McSweeney, E. Kennedy, O. O’Regan 3/8/03 Start 0.5m (!) left of The Revolution Has Begun and go up to groove. Then onto good jug. Mantleshelf onto the crux move (crimp) and then work towards tree on horizontal cracks. Break onto arete. Poor gear on top section but good at bottom, mostly friends. 7:THE REVOLUTION HAS BEGUN 12m HVS 5a/E1 5b D. O’Toole 27/10/01 Boulder start off the horizontal crack. Reach diagonally up left to a horizontal hold, then straight to top via good crimps. Protection is small aliens and red HB offset brassie, all good. 8:TITANIC ** 12m VS 4b Short but steep. Climb the hand crack on the right hand side of the crag. 9:THE PRODIGAL SON 10m HVS 5a R. Stack, P. Costelloe. 15/9/91. Climb the thin line 2-3m to the right of Titanic. ==Bothán - East Side of the Gap== This buttress is situated directly above Black Stream Bridge on the east side of the valley. Walk 100m past the bridge to two small quarried areas on the left hand side of the road, from here head straight up to the crag. It can be quite exposed to wind, which is good if the midges are out, but bad if it‟s cold. The crag dries quickly after rain and seepage isn‟t a problem on most routes. West facing; a good spot for evening sunshine. LEFT BUTTRESS APRIL SUNSHINE 15m M S Start about 3m left of \"The Ego Has Landed\", climbing the left corner of the lower face, proceed up the middle of the second section, getting behind the holly tree. Good holds, but poor protection. 1:THE EGO HAS LANDED 15m VS 4c A.Forde, I.Counihan. 15/9/90 Arete above a large ledge on the extreme left of the buttress. Protection is sparse. 2:FIRST COME FIRST SERVED * 15m VS 4b T. Long, D. Mulcahy. 6/4/95 Climb the line between The Ego Has Landed and Agent Orange. Climb directly up to the crackline and continue straight up to the top. 3:AGENT ORANGE 15m HS 4b I.Counihan, A.Forde. 15/9/90 Large crack and corner on the left hand side of the buttress. FULCRUM 20m HVS 5a R. Stack, C. Cudden, A. Forde 15/5/93 This route is between 3 and 4. Climb up to a ledge (overhanging) and then up the left side of the face above to another ledge. Continue up existing over a small overhang at the top. 4:PRIVATE INVESTIGATIONS * 20m VS 4c C. Moriarty, M. Shea. August '86 Climb up left of the overhang to gain a ledge. From the ledge step right and climb up to another ledge. Veer left at the blank face and climb over a small overhang near the top. 5:LJUBLJANA ** 20m E1 5c R. Stack, B. Forde. 3/8/91 Start to the right of Private Investigations, climb the face onto the ledge, climb over the obvious protruding spike and then over the overhang and continue straight to the top. 6:DISCO LEGS ** 20m E3 5c P. Hoy 4/9/99 (climbed past crux previously but was unclaimed) Between B5 and B6, straight to roof, pocket, sidepull (not the loose one on the left), direct to top past sloping breaks. Finish up the crack of Raven. Pumpy but protection is good. 7:RAVEN ** 20m VS 4b This climb is on the right hand side of the buttress. Climb through the obvious breech in the overhang to a small quartz vein, traverse left and ascend the crack. Protection is poor at the start. A variation is to traverse half way across and climb over the small overhang (5a). 8:BUGLER 20m VS 4b Start as for Raven but continue straight to the top (over a holly bush). Protection is poor at the start. 9:FIACH DUBH 15m VS 4c R. Creagh, D.Dineen. 02/05/10. Start as for Raven. Standing on the first ledge arrange gear in the crack, then step out right onto the face gaining good holds. Go straight to the top from here, keeping left of a small bush and going past a short slab and through the overhang at 3/4 height. Beware of loose rock. 10:RESPECT 15m HVS 5a B. O’Dwyer, E. Lawless 21/4/00 Start just to the right of the arete to the right of Bugler. A poorly protected dynamic move over the bulge (long reach helps). Tend leftwards along the obvious line to the top. 11:ADRIAN'S ROUTE 12m VS 4c This route is on the far right of the buttress 3-4m around the corner from Bugler. Climb the faint overhanging corner, move right and climb straight to the top. The most difficult moves are at the start where the protection is poorest. 12:BACK OR BRAIN 6m VS 4b I. Counihan, R. Stack. 14/4/91 Start 2-3m to the right of Adrian's Route. Start on a small ledge right of a large holly tree. Climb the obvious line veering slightly right towards the top. BERRY FUNNY 6m VDiff Start right of Back Or Brain. Climb diagonal crack to the right exiting left of holly tree. Not first ascent, first recorded. RIGHT BUTTRESS SETANTA 8m S Start on the first flat rock at the base on the chimney, left of \"Akimbo\". Climb the right hand wall of the chimney, using the good hand and footholds, climbing slightly left to the highest point of the face. Protection is poor. 13:AKIMBO * 7m HS 4b/c J. Behal, C. Cudden 13/9/95 Climb the arete left of The Hobbit. Poor protection at the start. 14:THE HOBBIT 6m HS 4b R. Stack, B. Forde. 3/8/91 Climb the slightly overhanging crack left of the obvious corner (which contains a tree.) 15:BALDY 10m VS 4c M Shea, B.Galvin Summer '90 Climb the edge of the face to the left of Spider. Protection is poor. 16:SPIDER 10m Severe Climb up the blank face on the left side of the buttress. This climb weaves back and forth. Protection is poor. 16A:CRAZY FROG 9m HVS 4c Start just left of the small holly tree midway along the base of the climbs. Climb up just left of the tree on sidepulls and undercuts. Crux. Continue directly up to the top. Protection is poor. 17:P.O.S. 8m V.Diff R. Stack, P. Cudden. Jan '89 (pile of shite?) Start about 5m to the right of Spider and climb the obvious line to the top. ==The Chimneys== The area known as The Chimneys is situated on the eastern side of the Gap of Dunloe, above Bothán crag. They are broken down into three main outcrops. The approach is as for Bothán, but continue in a north easterly direction for approx. 10 minutes and you will arrive at the crags. The approach after leaving Bothán may be difficult as the heather in high….but I think its worth the effort. There seems to be very little seepage there. HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN VS 18m Start on the left of the smaller crag at the left of the chimneys. Climb the obvious crack and stay left of the tree root. Climb straight up till you arrive at the ledge (avoid the temptation to move right on the High Hopes), instead, climb the overhanging face topping out a little higher than High Hopes. HIGH HOPES S 18m This climb is on the very left of the outcrops, at the base of the large triangular rock. Start in the very obvious corner, climbing up to the overhang, move left, climb past the bush, moving slightly right before climbing to the top of the crag. PEARLY GATES S 18m Ger Cronin/John O'Sullivan S Start as for High Hopes, but instead of going left at the overhang, climb straight up the face, topping out at the top out for High Hopes CRONINS YARD VDIFF 16m The start for this is about 50m to the right, and slightly uphill from High Hopes, Start at the left hand corner of the small crag, and climb the corner to the heathery covering. The decent is off to the left of the top out and down the small gully THE STEPS VDIFF 14m The Steps is on the left corner of the next major crag after Cronins Yard, Climb the obvious steps, finishing on the first major heathery ledge you reach. Avoid the temptation to climb further, as it makes your decent to your left very tricky MAIDEN VOYAGE MS 15m Start about 4m to the right of The Steps, climb the rock which has a concave shape, climbing straight up the flat face and topping out at the obvious crack in the rock at the top of the climb. VERTICAL LIMIT VS 46m On the crag on the southern end of the Chimneys, Start at the base of the obvious crack, climb straight up, over the small overhang, onto the ledge, from here climb straight up the blocky climb to highest point in the crag. Protection is good. Decent from here is off to the right of the crag as you face it. ==Carraig Ceannann== This is the most northerly of the cliffs on the western side of the valley. About 1 Km up the Gap turn right and walk up the Cora Road (at the \"Going Climbing\" sign). Follow this zig zag road up to the nearest point to an obvious white buttress this is lower Carraig Ceannann. A few metres up and around the corner is an obvious off-width crack, this is the line of Moloise. Further left you will come to upper Carraig Ceannann. 1:ERICA 10m V.Diff A. Forde, B. Forde. 22/4/90 Start 2m right of the mossy gully on the extreme left hand end of Carraig Ceannann, keeping a small clump of heather on your right hand side. Climb up to a right tending diagonal line, continue along this and exit on an easy right tending ramp at the top. 2:EASY ROUTE 10m Severe C. Moriarty (Solo) August '86 This climb is to the right of Erica. Climb the blank face, following no definite line. Protection is poor. 3:TAR WARS * 20m E1 5c A. Forde, B. Forde. 28/4/90 The furthest left crack through the small roof left of Cuchulainn. 1. 15m Climb the crack through the roof (crux) and belay on the grass ledge. 2. 5m Climb the wall behind and slightly right of the first pitch to finish left of the large block on top. 4:DIVING FOR PEARLS ** 25m E2 5c,5c A. Forde, R. Stack. 15/9/90 1. 15m Start at a narrow chimney 2m right of Tar Wars. Climb this past an upside down slot to another slot. Move up and left to gain the upper wall. Belay on the large ledge above. 2. 10m From the ledge gain a small corner above a rose bush, climb the upper wall on good holds to the left hand side of a large block on top. CHRISTMAS JUMPER 30m E2 5b/c R. Creagh, J. Eldred. 23/11/14 (Toproped beforehand; it was wet and looked harder!) A bit eliminate but worth a go if you've done the other routes here. Climb Cuchulainn to the holly tree. Move left and climb the wall left of the corner, passing through the overhangs using a few holds common with Cuchulainn but keeping out of the corner proper. 5:CUCHULAINN ** 30m HVS 5a C. Moriarty, A. Forde. July '84 This route follows the obvious line to the left of the main overhang. Traverse in from the left to the base of the line. Climb straight up the obvious line to an awkward overhanging niche. Continue to the large ledge (small holly tree in crack) climb straight up the overhanging corner (difficult to protect) and on to the top on good holds. CUCHULAINN-VARIATION 28m E1 5b Follow Cuchulainn to the holly bush. From here traverse right up the flat wall and continue up up to the top. 6:FERDIA ** 26m HVS 5a A. Forde, C. Moriarty. July '84 From the start of Cuchulainn climb up and right into a corner. Climb this to the overhang before breaking out right to a large ledge. Continue up the narrow chimney to the roof before turning awkwardly right again, and up into the final niche. Escape out left and up to the top. 7:FERDIA DIRECT 40m E2 5c M Shea, B. Forde. September '89 Instead of traversing from Cuchulainn to the start of Ferdia, start at the lowest point of the line. Climb the line to a small overhang (crux), Move slightly left to surmount this and then onto the original route. 8:VALHALLA 30m E1 5c I. Counihan, A. Forde. 24/4/90 The line immediately right of Ferdia."

April '86 Climb the obvious off-width right-tending crack line on the right hand side of the buttress. The most difficult moves are at the start, where the protection is poorest. 12:BASH ON REGARDLESS *** 25m E1/2 5b/5c A. Forde, A. Devlin. November '85 This climb is in the corner 5m right of Moloise, Climb the slight corner to the large block. Finish up the face by delicate moves. Protection is poor at the start. Holly tree belay. Abseil or walk off above and to the right. 13:BLACK FRIDAY *** 20m E2 5b A. Forde, R. Stack. 13/4/90 Protection is poor initially which accounts for the high grade. Start a few metres right of Bash on Regardless. Climb up to a horizontal quartz vein (at 5m), traverse right to a horizontal finger crack and climb up to a small ledge at half height. Continue up and left to a large flake.

Forde. 28/4/90 Climb the obvious corner and crack line on the right hand end of the buttress. ==Brennans Leap== This crag is situated on the road side beside the Black Lake (First Lake). Note: It is recommended that people don't climb on this crag during the day (between 9 am and 6pm), as climbing activities (rattling of gear and bright colours etc.) can startle the horses carrying people on the road. Left Buttress 1:NANUK 8m VS 4b Unknown Thin line on the left hand side of the crag.

It can be quite exposed to wind, which is good if the midges are out, but bad if it‟s cold. The crag dries quickly after rain and seepage isn‟t a problem on most routes. West facing; a good spot for evening sunshine.

Finish up the crack of Raven. Pumpy but protection is good. 7:RAVEN ** 20m VS 4b This climb is on the right hand side of the buttress. Climb through the obvious breech in the overhang to a small quartz vein, traverse left and ascend the crack. Protection is poor at the start. A variation is to traverse half way across and climb over the small overhang (5a). 8:BUGLER 20m VS 4b Start as for Raven but continue straight to the top (over a holly bush). Protection is poor at the start. 9:FIACH DUBH 15m VS 4c R. Creagh, D.Dineen. 02/05/10. Start as for Raven. Standing on the first ledge arrange gear in the crack, then step out right onto the face gaining good holds.

Start about 5m to the right of Spider and climb the obvious line to the top. ==The Chimneys== The area known as The Chimneys is situated on the eastern side of the Gap of Dunloe, above Bothán crag. They are broken down into three main outcrops. The approach is as for Bothán, but continue in a north easterly direction for approx. 10 minutes and you will arrive at the crags. The approach after leaving Bothán may be difficult as the heather in high….but I think its worth the effort. There seems to be very little seepage there. HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN VS 18m Start on the left of the smaller crag at the left of the chimneys. Climb the obvious crack and stay left of the tree root. Climb straight up till you arrive at the ledge (avoid the temptation to move right on the High Hopes), instead, climb the overhanging face topping out a little higher than High Hopes.

BERRY FUNNY 6m VDiff Start right of Back Or Brain. Climb diagonal crack to the right exiting left of holly tree. Not first ascent, first recorded. RIGHT BUTTRESS SETANTA 8m S Start on the first flat rock at the base on the chimney, left of \"Akimbo\". Climb the right hand wall of the chimney, using the good hand and footholds, climbing slightly left to the highest point of the face. Protection is poor. 13:AKIMBO * 7m HS 4b/c J. Behal, C.

Continue directly up to the top. Protection is poor. 17:P.O.S. 8m V.Diff R. Stack, P. Cudden. Jan '89 (pile of shite?) Start about 5m to the right of Spider and climb the obvious line to the top. ==The Chimneys== The area known as The Chimneys is situated on the eastern side of the Gap of Dunloe, above Bothán crag. They are broken down into three main outcrops. The approach is as for Bothán, but continue in a north easterly direction for approx. 10 minutes and you will arrive at the crags. The approach after leaving Bothán may be difficult as the heather in high….but I think its worth the effort. There seems to be very little seepage there. HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN VS 18m Start on the left of the smaller crag at the left of the chimneys. Climb the obvious crack and stay left of the tree root. Climb straight up till you arrive at the ledge (avoid the temptation to move right on the High Hopes), instead, climb the overhanging face topping out a little higher than High Hopes. HIGH HOPES S 18m This climb is on the very left of the outcrops, at the base of the large triangular rock. Start in the very obvious corner, climbing up to the overhang, move left, climb past the bush, moving slightly right before climbing to the top of the crag. PEARLY GATES S 18m Ger Cronin/John O'Sullivan S Start as for High Hopes, but instead of going left at the overhang, climb straight up the face, topping out at the top out for High Hopes CRONINS YARD VDIFF 16m The start for this is about 50m to the right, and slightly uphill from High Hopes, Start at the left hand corner of the small crag, and climb the corner to the heathery covering. The decent is off to the left of the top out and down the small gully THE STEPS VDIFF 14m The Steps is on the left corner of the next major crag after Cronins Yard, Climb the obvious steps, finishing on the first major heathery ledge you reach. Avoid the temptation to climb further, as it makes your decent to your left very tricky MAIDEN VOYAGE MS 15m Start about 4m to the right of The Steps, climb the rock which has a concave shape, climbing straight up the flat face and topping out at the obvious crack in the rock at the top of the climb. VERTICAL LIMIT VS 46m On the crag on the southern end of the Chimneys, Start at the base of the obvious crack, climb straight up, over the small overhang, onto the ledge, from here climb straight up the blocky climb to highest point in the crag. Protection is good. Decent from here is off to the right of the crag as you face it. ==Carraig Ceannann== This is the most northerly of the cliffs on the western side of the valley. About 1 Km up the Gap turn right and walk up the Cora Road (at the \"Going Climbing\" sign). Follow this zig zag road up to the nearest point to an obvious white buttress this is lower Carraig Ceannann. A few metres up and around the corner is an obvious off-width crack, this is the line of Moloise. Further left you will come to upper Carraig Ceannann. 1:ERICA 10m V.Diff A. Forde, B. Forde. 22/4/90 Start 2m right of the mossy gully on the extreme left hand end of Carraig Ceannann, keeping a small clump of heather on your right hand side. Climb up to a right tending diagonal line, continue along this and exit on an easy right tending ramp at the top. 2:EASY ROUTE 10m Severe C. Moriarty (Solo) August '86 This climb is to the right of Erica. Climb the blank face, following no definite line. Protection is poor. 3:TAR WARS * 20m E1 5c A. Forde, B. Forde. 28/4/90 The furthest left crack through the small roof left of Cuchulainn. 1. 15m Climb the crack through the roof (crux) and belay on the grass ledge. 2. 5m Climb the wall behind and slightly right of the first pitch to finish left of the large block on top. 4:DIVING FOR PEARLS ** 25m E2 5c,5c A. Forde, R. Stack. 15/9/90 1. 15m Start at a narrow chimney 2m right of Tar Wars. Climb this past an upside down slot to another slot. Move up and left to gain the upper wall. Belay on the large ledge above. 2. 10m From the ledge gain a small corner above a rose bush, climb the upper wall on good holds to the left hand side of a large block on top. CHRISTMAS JUMPER 30m E2 5b/c R. Creagh, J. Eldred. 23/11/14 (Toproped beforehand; it was wet and looked harder!) A bit eliminate but worth a go if you've done the other routes here. Climb Cuchulainn to the holly tree. Move left and climb the wall left of the corner, passing through the overhangs using a few holds common with Cuchulainn but keeping out of the corner proper. 5:CUCHULAINN ** 30m HVS 5a C. Moriarty, A. Forde. July '84 This route follows the obvious line to the left of the main overhang. Traverse in from the left to the base of the line. Climb straight up the obvious line to an awkward overhanging niche. Continue to the large ledge (small holly tree in crack) climb straight up the overhanging corner (difficult to protect) and on to the top on good holds. CUCHULAINN-VARIATION 28m E1 5b Follow Cuchulainn to the holly bush. From here traverse right up the flat wall and continue up up to the top. 6:FERDIA ** 26m HVS 5a A. Forde, C. Moriarty. July '84 From the start of Cuchulainn climb up and right into a corner. Climb this to the overhang before breaking out right to a large ledge. Continue up the narrow chimney to the roof before turning awkwardly right again, and up into the final niche. Escape out left and up to the top. 7:FERDIA DIRECT 40m E2 5c M Shea, B. Forde. September '89 Instead of traversing from Cuchulainn to the start of Ferdia, start at the lowest point of the line. Climb the line to a small overhang (crux), Move slightly left to surmount this and then onto the original route. 8:VALHALLA 30m E1 5c I. Counihan, A.

It contains two large ledges, the lower one having a large overhang above it. There are many fine long routes on this buttress. At the back left hand side of the first ledge there is a holly tree which acts as an abseil point. Because the overhang hinders further ascent, many of the routes finish on the first ledge. Different routes can also be combined. The first pitch of Seventh Heaven and finishing on Jamaica Plain makes a fine route. The top ledge (Burnt Ledge) can be scrambled onto from the right hand side. From the base of the buttress traverse around and up the right hand side of the buttress. Climb the shallow steep gully, which is overgrown with trees.

It contains two large ledges, the lower one having a large overhang above it. There are many fine long routes on this buttress. At the back left hand side of the first ledge there is a holly tree which acts as an abseil point. Because the overhang hinders further ascent, many of the routes finish on the first ledge. Different routes can also be combined. The first pitch of Seventh Heaven and finishing on Jamaica Plain makes a fine route. The top ledge (Burnt Ledge) can be scrambled onto from the right hand side. From the base of the buttress traverse around and up the right hand side of the buttress. Climb the shallow steep gully, which is overgrown with trees.

They are broken down into three main outcrops. The approach is as for Bothán, but continue in a north easterly direction for approx. 10 minutes and you will arrive at the crags. The approach after leaving Bothán may be difficult as the heather in high….but I think its worth the effort. There seems to be very little seepage there.

From here move airily out right and follow the crack to the top left hand side of the cliff. ==Glas Lough Crag== From the lay-by at the head of the Gap head up the track towards Purple Mountain. After about 15 minutes the crags appear on the right. The rock looks broken on most of these cliffs with few very obvious lines. There is a rowan tree near the river towards the north end of the crag. Head straight towards the wall from this tree. STRANGE CREATION 12m HVS 5a R. Creagh, D. Dineen, 22/05/10. Near the wall there is a small arch created by 2 blocks. Just right of this a thin, broken, right-trending crack starts. Start here and follow the crack until you can gain the ramp. Go right up this for 2m and then straight up under a thin, closed crack further up. Exit right (loose)"
