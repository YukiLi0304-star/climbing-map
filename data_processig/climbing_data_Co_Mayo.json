Gain starting niche by long rightwards traverse from the platform, or by abseiling into the back of the zawn and shorter traverse and shorter traverse left from boulders Waterfall Cove, Achill Badger Slabs 800px The west facing side of Waterfall Cove is a series of slabs and arêtes. The right most slab is the most extensive and has a gently sloping platform (tidal in part) at its base. The lower right portion of the slab is recessed and there is a cave left of this. Stakes allow an abseil to the platform at this cave and access to routes 9-18. (61). 9. Funnel Web, HS (4a) 30m This climb takes a line up the large slab left of Achill Badger, a poor and loose route. Start in corner on right of slab, up this for 5 meters to obvious horizontal crack, traverse left to slab edge, up edge of slab until poor rock pushes you right, up middle of slab to finish. Safest belay option for routes 10-18 is to leave abseil in situ and belay at top lip of slab/ cliff, below loose top out (62). 10. The Fox * S (4a) 25m Takes the corner just left of Achill Badger, up corner to overhang traverse right under overhang to finish as for Achill Badger (63). 11. Achill Badger ** S (4a) 25m A quality, well protected route. Makes a route up the left edge of the main slab. Follow flakey cracks immediately right of the slab edge. Finish up wide crack. 12.Alternate Start 1 ** S (4a) 8m Climb the left trending crack to join the original route near the arête. 13.Alternate Start 2 * HVS (5a) 12m Climb thin crack up centre of of slab to horizontal break, Traverse left to original route.

The Myth of Trust ** HVS (5a) 30m Start 6 meters right of Achill Badger and climb cracks slanting rightwards to the edge of the main slab. Lay off arête (Bold crux) to gain a wide leftwards slanting crack. Up this and finish as for Achill Badger (67). 15. Atlantic City * VS (4c) 30m Start in the cave. Surmount jammed block at back of cave. Traverse right to recessed slab and up to overhung niche. Through overhang (crux) to small ledge. Continue up short corner crack, move left and finish by crack in wall left of small slab (Belay here before grass is reached) (68). 15a. Exiting the Womb** VS (4c) 30m An entertaining, unique and varied route. Start as for Atlantic City. After surmounting the jammed block go left instead of right, squeezing yourself between the ever-encroaching walls of the cave until you emerge into the daylight at the bottom of the wide crack of The Myth of Trust. Finish as for this route or go right about 7m below the top, following a line of 3 parallel hairline cracks (HVS 5a). R.Creagh, C.Hogan 25/06/12 (69). 16. Sapphire * HVS (5a) 30m Start below centre of recessed slab (tide permitting), initial hard moves to gain slab. Directly up slab to overhang. Committing move to gain jug and pull up to upper slab. Easy fault right then left to ledges. Horizontally left to finish as for Atlantic City (70). 17. Hail Stone Corner S (4a) 25m The corner which marks the right end of the recessed slab. Traverse right beneath overhanging blacks near the top to finish at arête. (71). 18. Escape Route Diff 30m The easiest route up cracks and blocks right of hailstone corner to a breech left of a small pinnacle. Scramble up arête to finish. East of Waterfall Cove, Dingo Area Facing the open sea around the arête is a square non tidal ledge. In good weather this is a real suntrap. It can be reached by traversing round from Waterfall cove, down climbing Touché Turtle or by abseil (72). 19. Touché Turtle * Diff 30m Climb the scoop just left of Suntrap ledge. Continue up easy angled corner to arête. Up this as for Escape Route. (73). 20. Levon Helm * E1 (5c) 30m Climbs the corner at the back of suntrap ledge. Technical moves to gain groove, finish more easily up right edge of slab Alt finish, Place protection on right of slab, traverse left 2 meters to finish directly up centre of slab (5b) (74). 21. Gleaning the Crumbs * HVS (5b) 20m From the right edge of suntrap ledge. Up short rightwards leading slab then back left through overhang. Easy ground to top. (75). 22. Dingo ** S (4a) 25m Traverse right from ledge across a chimney to the next wall. Take the crack up the middle of this wall. Excellent situations for the grade, maybe safer to abseil into hanging belay (76). 23. Indian Summer * S (4a) 25m Takes the arête forming the right edge of Dingo wall. Traverse or abseil to hanging belay just left of arête. Traverse right to arête, up arête (No protection for 4 meters) and continue direct to easier ground above East of Waterfall Cove, Achill Slab and Fair Dinkum Area The next two routes start from a platform beneath an intimidating overhanging wall right of Dingo. The platform can be reached by abseil or by down climbing Achill Slab. (77). 24. Achill Slab S (3c) 20m The slab that forms the left boundary of the large overhanging wall and lies to the right of the wall Dingo is situated on (78). 25. Zawn Chorus HVS (4c) 25m Take a slanting right to left line of weakness which becomes a chimney. At 12 meters traverse left across a well hung slab (often damp) to exposed ledge. Up sandy corner above, finishing out left of capstone. Poor rock at top needs to be cleaned (the last 2m were top roped) Right of the overhanging wall is a smooth, bulging arête and then a deep cut chimney/ zawn. Right again are three routes. These can be easily reached by descending gentle slabs further to the east and traversing round. This is around 50m east of Waterfall Cove (79). 26. Achilldorightly * V.Diff 15m The stepped corner 6m right of the deep cut chimney/ zawn. Take the line of least resistance and finish entertainingly wide chimney Direct finish, VS (4c) 15m. Up stepped corner to ledge, straight up from ledge through overhanging corner/ crack. Short but strenuous (80). 27. Fair Dinkum * E2 (5b) 15m A thin crack splitting the steep wall 2m right of Achilldorightly. Sustained quality climbing , small wires for protection (81). 28. Billy the Fish HVS (5a) 15m The right to left slanting crack line (often damp) 2m right of Fair Dinkum. Try to ignore the two large ledges leading out rightwards ==Mweelaun Rocks== (West of Waterfall Cove) These crags are located east of Waterfall cove/ Achilldorightly wall. Across from the rock platform from Achilldorightly wall is a small zawn with an east facing wall. A few short easy routes can be found here. The west facing wall, with dark coloured rock, has a slab section at its base, with a distinct overhang at 2/3 Height. The next set of routes are on this wall Approach- Abseil into high tide mark, beneath overhangs, all routes start from here. Routes described from left/right 800px Above, Mweelaun Rocks (82). 1.Rosco V Diff 12m Traverse left from slabs, crossing Uncle Jess and well featured wall, straight up to ledge, finish easily. Carl Maddox, 12/06/09 (83). 2.Uncle Jess Mod 10m Obvious line of weakness left of overhangs. Trend up and left in groove to ledge. Then rightwards in groove to finish. Carl Maddox, Solo, 12/06/09 (84). 3.PG Tips * S (4a) 10m Start on left side of slab, up quartz crack to overhang and crack. Up this (crux) to finish Paddy Gethings, 12/06/09 (85). 4.Boss Hog * VS (4c) 10m Climbs the right side of slab, following thin quartz crack.

Move right then left through head wall on excellent holds Paddy Gethings, 12/06/09 ==Carrickmore Point== West again of Mweelaun rocks/ zawn is a small rocky peninsula, which marks the end of the main cliffs section. This area has a short, steep wall, with a partly tidal platform (platform can be slippy in places). The left wall is steep with an undercut base. It has a distinct left trending crack, a steep vertical crack and overhangs to the right 800px Left Photo, Mweelaun rocks in foreground, with left wall and Carrickmore point behind 800px Above, Carrickmore Point (87). a1.Fred Flintstone * HS (4a/b) 15m A nice climb, with some fiddly Cam placements. Start on the far left of the steep wall, by the large left sloping roof. Pull up steeply on good holds to gain the obvious horizontal foot crack.

The right most slab is the most extensive and has a gently sloping platform (tidal in part) at its base. The lower right portion of the slab is recessed and there is a cave left of this. Stakes allow an abseil to the platform at this cave and access to routes 9-18. (61). 9. Funnel Web, HS (4a) 30m This climb takes a line up the large slab left of Achill Badger, a poor and loose route. Start in corner on right of slab, up this for 5 meters to obvious horizontal crack, traverse left to slab edge, up edge of slab until poor rock pushes you right, up middle of slab to finish. Safest belay option for routes 10-18 is to leave abseil in situ and belay at top lip of slab/ cliff, below loose top out (62). 10.

Pat Rodgers, Kieran Wilson, 8/9/94. The nest route is situated to the left of the peninsula about 50m from SPERANZA. Abseil down to a long narrow ledge just above high water mark. ELEGANT ELEPHANT VD 12m Climb the obvious crack to the right o the platform. Kieran Wilson, Helen Bradley, Pat Rodgers, 9/9/94. ==SLIEVEMORE== Around 15 routes ranging from long easy and accessible slab climbing to more mountain style climbs topping out on the Slievemore ridge. Some of the shorter slab climbs start above steep, grassy approaches so an abseil might offer a more relaxed and logical approach, albeit missing the original adventure of grass and heather belays. A bit of cleaning would bring plenty of new route potential and the current climbs such as Natasha VS and Bitch out Route E2 offer good example's of the climbing quality. Diff 2 Routes V Diff 2 Routes Severe 5 Routes HS 1 Route VS 3 Routes HVS 1 Route E2 1 Route ==DUGORT SLABS== The lowest two crags on the North West Flank of Slievemore Ridge, 15 mins. walk from Dugort Quay Road.

Billy the Fish HVS (5a) 15m The right to left slanting crack line (often damp) 2m right of Fair Dinkum. Try to ignore the two large ledges leading out rightwards ==Mweelaun Rocks== (West of Waterfall Cove) These crags are located east of Waterfall cove/ Achilldorightly wall. Across from the rock platform from Achilldorightly wall is a small zawn with an east facing wall. A few short easy routes can be found here. The west facing wall, with dark coloured rock, has a slab section at its base, with a distinct overhang at 2/3 Height. The next set of routes are on this wall Approach- Abseil into high tide mark, beneath overhangs, all routes start from here.

Move right then left through head wall on excellent holds Paddy Gethings, 12/06/09 ==Carrickmore Point== West again of Mweelaun rocks/ zawn is a small rocky peninsula, which marks the end of the main cliffs section. This area has a short, steep wall, with a partly tidal platform (platform can be slippy in places). The left wall is steep with an undercut base. It has a distinct left trending crack, a steep vertical crack and overhangs to the right 800px Left Photo, Mweelaun rocks in foreground, with left wall and Carrickmore point behind 800px Above, Carrickmore Point (87). a1.Fred Flintstone * HS (4a/b) 15m A nice climb, with some fiddly Cam placements. Start on the far left of the steep wall, by the large left sloping roof. Pull up steeply on good holds to gain the obvious horizontal foot crack. Traverse entire wall to overhang, step round this and over the void to finish. Bring a good range of Cams to keep you afloat. Carl Maddox, Lisa Kennedy 25/09/13 (88). 1.Daisy Duke ** HS (4b) 10m Take the central crack straight up the steep left wall, crossing several horizontal breaks (cams useful). A great little route, easier than it looks Carl Maddox, 12/06/09 Just right of the left wall is a pebbled slab (89). 2.Pebbles Diff 9m Start at the lowest point of the slab, straight up, taking care with the pebbles Carl Maddox Solo, 12/06/09 Right again of pebble dashed slab is a steep pebble wall At the end of the peninsula is a short 8m wall, of very weathered rock, several lines can be tackled between mod-diff standard (90). 3.Barney Rubble Mod 8m Straight up brown wall to highly weathered finish Carl Maddox Solo, 12/06/09 PEBBLEDASH PILLAR Diff 15m Step across below belay (at low tide only) to scramble up to the top of the pillar.

SPERANZA VS 12m Start easily up the crack in the slightly overhanging wall. Move up and left on the ramp. Finish up the obvious short crack at the top of the ramp (crux). Pat Rodgers, Kieran Wilson, 8/9/94. The nest route is situated to the left of the peninsula about 50m from SPERANZA. Abseil down to a long narrow ledge just above high water mark. ELEGANT ELEPHANT VD 12m Climb the obvious crack to the right o the platform. Kieran Wilson, Helen Bradley, Pat Rodgers, 9/9/94. ==SLIEVEMORE== Around 15 routes ranging from long easy and accessible slab climbing to more mountain style climbs topping out on the Slievemore ridge. Some of the shorter slab climbs start above steep, grassy approaches so an abseil might offer a more relaxed and logical approach, albeit missing the original adventure of grass and heather belays. A bit of cleaning would bring plenty of new route potential and the current climbs such as Natasha VS and Bitch out Route E2 offer good example's of the climbing quality. Diff 2 Routes V Diff 2 Routes Severe 5 Routes HS 1 Route VS 3 Routes HVS 1 Route E2 1 Route ==DUGORT SLABS== The lowest two crags on the North West Flank of Slievemore Ridge, 15 mins. walk from Dugort Quay Road. PIRATE 52m Diff Clare Sheridan, Joss Lynam (shared leads) and AFAS party 30.6.74 Start 20m. left of the lowest point of the right hand side of the first crag, the middle of the smooth white slab. 1. 15m.

Move right and ascend the slab to stance at blocks. (The steep wall on pitch 2 can be climbed to the left of the belay at between severe and hard severe) The second crag is separated from the first by an open gully. Scramble along rough ground below the crag until an obvious pink slab comes into view. This is: PINKIE 35m Diff Joss Lynam, Lesley Richardson. 15.6.75 Start on a rib barely emerging from the heather, to the left, and below the slab. 1. 25m. Climb onto the slab and go straight up to a big recess. 2. 10m. Climb the wall on the right in a corner. Beyond Pinkie are a number of short slabs and corners of insufficient sustained interest to be worth recording. Near the right hand end of the crag is a vertical rib. This is: SALAMANDER 22m Severe 4a Carl Maddox, Jason Ryan 11.05.08 The obvious hanging slab half way between Pinkee and Production line. Scramble up grassy ledges to vegetated corner/ wall below and right of the clean hanging slab. (Abseil approach maybe easier). Move up and trend left on on vegetated rock to overhanging block, move left round block then step right to grass ledge. Traverse left along huge block and crack to slab base. Directly up clean well featured slab to finish. Right of Salamander and left of the rib start of Production line, is another hanging slab, with a large overhang at its base, the next climb starts below the right side of the slab and overhangs. Best approached by abseil. AMPHIBIAN 20m Severe 4a (Possibly HS 4a due to bold section) Carl Maddox, Neal McAloon 01.08.10 Take the broken rock and vegetation just right of overhangs. A tricky and scruffy start leads straight to better climbing up the right side of slab. Drop a cam at base of slab and move boldly for six meters to horizontal break and easier climbing to top. PRODUCTION LINE 28m V Diff Joss Lynam, Lesley Richardson. 15.6.75 Start at the foot of the rib (the belay is higher up on the right. 1. 20m. Climb up the series of big steps on the rib. Where the rib loses itself in the face, bridge up the corner and belay on the shelf above. Walk 12m. left along the shelf to the foot of a slab with an overlap to its right side. 2. 8m. Climb the pleasant slab. ==FIRST PINNACLE BUTTRESS== This is the big gable-ended crag halfway up the Slievemore Ridge from Dugort. It is best reached by climbing the ridge and then traversing in to the foot of the buttress. The most obvious point of reference is a white wall at about mid height on the western face. GREAT WESTERN 130m VS N. Allen, Sheilagh Manning, M. McDonagh. 11.6.75 Start at the foot of the nose where the north and west faces meet, either scramble up grass ledges on the right or traverse the left side of a semi-detached block via. an awkward corner. 1. 15m.

Climb a short corner on the left of the ledge, and the fine white wall to a good stance. Nut and piton belay. 4. 33m. Move right 3m. and climb the overlap and the short groove above, step left on grass and make a rising traverse to the right, to an obvious brown corner, climb this and step right at the top to a good stance. Piton belay below a big overlap. 5. 22m. Pad up the narrowing slab to the right and where the slab ends make a difficult mantle shelf. Ascend to the roof and traverse pleasantly left to finish up at a short steep wall, on the ridge. CRUSADE 80m HVS The route below takes the obvious diagonal line of narrow ramps and slabs up the North face of the First Pinnacle Buttress and finishes up a steep corner high on the left side of the face. Start as for Great Western, i.e. at the foot of the nose where the north and west faces meet. 1. 45m - 4c. Climb leftwards up the ramp on the side of the semi-detached block, and across the top of a corner to a good stance and possible belay. (Great Western goes straight up from here). Move left on slab and pull around the corner. Descend slightly and step across groove to gain slab on left with difficulty. Move up to crack, and up this a few feet until possible to traverse left across wall to a good foot ledge below the leftward trending narrow slab (the slab is split by a thin crack). Climb slab and continue up narrow ramps to a grass ledge beneath a wide crack. Peg and spike belays. 2. 35m - 5b. Climb wide crack to top of block. Traverse left across block to corner. Move around left edge of corner and gain a narrow ramp on face. Move up this a few feet until possible to climb onto sloping ledge above (crux).Climb steep corner above ledge and pull out right and gain top with an awkward mantelshelf. Scramble up 6m. for a nut and peg belay. Little Bitchitis 110m VS 4c 1) First pitch as for crusade 2) 4c- 20m climb up the wide crack to the top of the block and arrange protection. From the top of the block make an airy traverse to the right. Continue more easily upwards to a large grass ledge and belay. 3) 3c - 30m climb upwards to below the head wall.

Climb short corner and continue up veg. for a few feet. Step right onto a white wall and climb to ledge (coincides with upper part of pitch (3) of Great Western). Nut belay below overhang. 3. 42m. Step up and left to surmount overhang and continue straight up on easier ground, bearing right round overhangs (loose blocks). Choice of belays. 4. 18m. Climb easily and directly to top. Joss' Fault 62m S Joss Lynam, Bob Richardson (shared leads). 14.6.75 This goes up the rather obvious fault line which forms an incipient chimney in the nose about 20m. right of the white wall. Start at the foot of the fault. 1. 27m. Follow the line of the fault, mostly keeping to the right into a niche (pitch could be broken here). Climb up the slightly overhanging chimney above (crux) to a ledge on the left. Go up diagonally, right round the overhang to a terrace. Go up a further 4m. on vegetation to a wire chock belay. Beware of loose blocks on this pitch. 2. 35m. Climb the big slabby steps left of the impending wall. At about 20m. go left over a small wall into a big recess with an overhanging roof. Exit by the left wall and move up right to belays. To the left of the First Pinnacle Buttress is a smaller buttress. Left of centre on this is a big corner formed between a steep slab and a somewhat overhanging wall. There is an overhang across the top of the slab. The climb goes up the layback crack in the corner, then traverses left to a narrow vertical crack in the slab. NATASHA 30m VS 1. 22m. Reach the foot of the layback crack with some difficulty. Layback up to big overhang (moss on slab). Chock runner. Make a slightly descending traverse to the crack. Climb the crack jamming (crux) and exit left to a big ledge. 2. 8m.

ELEGANT ELEPHANT VD 12m Climb the obvious crack to the right o the platform. Kieran Wilson, Helen Bradley, Pat Rodgers, 9/9/94. ==SLIEVEMORE== Around 15 routes ranging from long easy and accessible slab climbing to more mountain style climbs topping out on the Slievemore ridge. Some of the shorter slab climbs start above steep, grassy approaches so an abseil might offer a more relaxed and logical approach, albeit missing the original adventure of grass and heather belays. A bit of cleaning would bring plenty of new route potential and the current climbs such as Natasha VS and Bitch out Route E2 offer good example's of the climbing quality. Diff 2 Routes V Diff 2 Routes Severe 5 Routes HS 1 Route VS 3 Routes HVS 1 Route E2 1 Route ==DUGORT SLABS== The lowest two crags on the North West Flank of Slievemore Ridge, 15 mins. walk from Dugort Quay Road.

Safest belay option for routes 10-18 is to leave abseil in situ and belay at top lip of slab/ cliff, below loose top out (66). 14. The Myth of Trust ** HVS (5a) 30m Start 6 meters right of Achill Badger and climb cracks slanting rightwards to the edge of the main slab. Lay off arête (Bold crux) to gain a wide leftwards slanting crack. Up this and finish as for Achill Badger (67). 15. Atlantic City * VS (4c) 30m Start in the cave. Surmount jammed block at back of cave. Traverse right to recessed slab and up to overhung niche. Through overhang (crux) to small ledge. Continue up short corner crack, move left and finish by crack in wall left of small slab (Belay here before grass is reached) (68). 15a. Exiting the Womb** VS (4c) 30m An entertaining, unique and varied route. Start as for Atlantic City. After surmounting the jammed block go left instead of right, squeezing yourself between the ever-encroaching walls of the cave until you emerge into the daylight at the bottom of the wide crack of The Myth of Trust. Finish as for this route or go right about 7m below the top, following a line of 3 parallel hairline cracks (HVS 5a). R.Creagh, C.Hogan 25/06/12 (69). 16.

Dingo ** S (4a) 25m Traverse right from ledge across a chimney to the next wall. Take the crack up the middle of this wall. Excellent situations for the grade, maybe safer to abseil into hanging belay (76). 23. Indian Summer * S (4a) 25m Takes the arête forming the right edge of Dingo wall. Traverse or abseil to hanging belay just left of arête. Traverse right to arête, up arête (No protection for 4 meters) and continue direct to easier ground above East of Waterfall Cove, Achill Slab and Fair Dinkum Area The next two routes start from a platform beneath an intimidating overhanging wall right of Dingo. The platform can be reached by abseil or by down climbing Achill Slab. (77). 24.

Zawn Chorus HVS (4c) 25m Take a slanting right to left line of weakness which becomes a chimney. At 12 meters traverse left across a well hung slab (often damp) to exposed ledge. Up sandy corner above, finishing out left of capstone. Poor rock at top needs to be cleaned (the last 2m were top roped) Right of the overhanging wall is a smooth, bulging arête and then a deep cut chimney/ zawn. Right again are three routes. These can be easily reached by descending gentle slabs further to the east and traversing round. This is around 50m east of Waterfall Cove (79). 26. Achilldorightly * V.Diff 15m The stepped corner 6m right of the deep cut chimney/ zawn. Take the line of least resistance and finish entertainingly wide chimney Direct finish, VS (4c) 15m. Up stepped corner to ledge, straight up from ledge through overhanging corner/ crack. Short but strenuous (80). 27.

Billy the Fish HVS (5a) 15m The right to left slanting crack line (often damp) 2m right of Fair Dinkum. Try to ignore the two large ledges leading out rightwards ==Mweelaun Rocks== (West of Waterfall Cove) These crags are located east of Waterfall cove/ Achilldorightly wall. Across from the rock platform from Achilldorightly wall is a small zawn with an east facing wall. A few short easy routes can be found here. The west facing wall, with dark coloured rock, has a slab section at its base, with a distinct overhang at 2/3 Height. The next set of routes are on this wall Approach- Abseil into high tide mark, beneath overhangs, all routes start from here.

Pat Rodgers, Kieran Wilson, 8/9/94. The nest route is situated to the left of the peninsula about 50m from SPERANZA. Abseil down to a long narrow ledge just above high water mark. ELEGANT ELEPHANT VD 12m Climb the obvious crack to the right o the platform. Kieran Wilson, Helen Bradley, Pat Rodgers, 9/9/94. ==SLIEVEMORE== Around 15 routes ranging from long easy and accessible slab climbing to more mountain style climbs topping out on the Slievemore ridge. Some of the shorter slab climbs start above steep, grassy approaches so an abseil might offer a more relaxed and logical approach, albeit missing the original adventure of grass and heather belays. A bit of cleaning would bring plenty of new route potential and the current climbs such as Natasha VS and Bitch out Route E2 offer good example's of the climbing quality.

ELEGANT ELEPHANT VD 12m Climb the obvious crack to the right o the platform. Kieran Wilson, Helen Bradley, Pat Rodgers, 9/9/94. ==SLIEVEMORE== Around 15 routes ranging from long easy and accessible slab climbing to more mountain style climbs topping out on the Slievemore ridge. Some of the shorter slab climbs start above steep, grassy approaches so an abseil might offer a more relaxed and logical approach, albeit missing the original adventure of grass and heather belays. A bit of cleaning would bring plenty of new route potential and the current climbs such as Natasha VS and Bitch out Route E2 offer good example's of the climbing quality. Diff 2 Routes V Diff 2 Routes Severe 5 Routes HS 1 Route VS 3 Routes HVS 1 Route E2 1 Route ==DUGORT SLABS== The lowest two crags on the North West Flank of Slievemore Ridge, 15 mins. walk from Dugort Quay Road. PIRATE 52m Diff Clare Sheridan, Joss Lynam (shared leads) and AFAS party 30.6.74 Start 20m. left of the lowest point of the right hand side of the first crag, the middle of the smooth white slab. 1. 15m.

Move right and ascend the slab to stance at blocks. (The steep wall on pitch 2 can be climbed to the left of the belay at between severe and hard severe) The second crag is separated from the first by an open gully. Scramble along rough ground below the crag until an obvious pink slab comes into view. This is: PINKIE 35m Diff Joss Lynam, Lesley Richardson. 15.6.75 Start on a rib barely emerging from the heather, to the left, and below the slab. 1. 25m. Climb onto the slab and go straight up to a big recess. 2. 10m. Climb the wall on the right in a corner. Beyond Pinkie are a number of short slabs and corners of insufficient sustained interest to be worth recording. Near the right hand end of the crag is a vertical rib. This is: SALAMANDER 22m Severe 4a Carl Maddox, Jason Ryan 11.05.08 The obvious hanging slab half way between Pinkee and Production line. Scramble up grassy ledges to vegetated corner/ wall below and right of the clean hanging slab. (Abseil approach maybe easier). Move up and trend left on on vegetated rock to overhanging block, move left round block then step right to grass ledge. Traverse left along huge block and crack to slab base. Directly up clean well featured slab to finish. Right of Salamander and left of the rib start of Production line, is another hanging slab, with a large overhang at its base, the next climb starts below the right side of the slab and overhangs. Best approached by abseil. AMPHIBIAN 20m Severe 4a (Possibly HS 4a due to bold section) Carl Maddox, Neal McAloon 01.08.10 Take the broken rock and vegetation just right of overhangs. A tricky and scruffy start leads straight to better climbing up the right side of slab. Drop a cam at base of slab and move boldly for six meters to horizontal break and easier climbing to top. PRODUCTION LINE 28m V Diff Joss Lynam, Lesley Richardson. 15.6.75 Start at the foot of the rib (the belay is higher up on the right. 1. 20m. Climb up the series of big steps on the rib. Where the rib loses itself in the face, bridge up the corner and belay on the shelf above. Walk 12m. left along the shelf to the foot of a slab with an overlap to its right side. 2. 8m. Climb the pleasant slab. ==FIRST PINNACLE BUTTRESS== This is the big gable-ended crag halfway up the Slievemore Ridge from Dugort. It is best reached by climbing the ridge and then traversing in to the foot of the buttress. The most obvious point of reference is a white wall at about mid height on the western face. GREAT WESTERN 130m VS N. Allen, Sheilagh Manning, M. McDonagh. 11.6.75 Start at the foot of the nose where the north and west faces meet, either scramble up grass ledges on the right or traverse the left side of a semi-detached block via. an awkward corner. 1. 15m. Climb a short steep corner, move left (right?) along a rake to stance on grass. Nut belay. 2. 30m. Step right onto the slab and make a long delicate traverse to a semi-cave below an overlap. Nut belay. 3. 30m. Move up and right onto a block, and climb leftwards to a good ledge below the prominent white wall. Climb a short corner on the left of the ledge, and the fine white wall to a good stance. Nut and piton belay. 4. 33m. Move right 3m. and climb the overlap and the short groove above, step left on grass and make a rising traverse to the right, to an obvious brown corner, climb this and step right at the top to a good stance. Piton belay below a big overlap. 5. 22m. Pad up the narrowing slab to the right and where the slab ends make a difficult mantle shelf. Ascend to the roof and traverse pleasantly left to finish up at a short steep wall, on the ridge. CRUSADE 80m HVS The route below takes the obvious diagonal line of narrow ramps and slabs up the North face of the First Pinnacle Buttress and finishes up a steep corner high on the left side of the face. Start as for Great Western, i.e. at the foot of the nose where the north and west faces meet. 1. 45m - 4c. Climb leftwards up the ramp on the side of the semi-detached block, and across the top of a corner to a good stance and possible belay. (Great Western goes straight up from here). Move left on slab and pull around the corner. Descend slightly and step across groove to gain slab on left with difficulty. Move up to crack, and up this a few feet until possible to traverse left across wall to a good foot ledge below the leftward trending narrow slab (the slab is split by a thin crack). Climb slab and continue up narrow ramps to a grass ledge beneath a wide crack. Peg and spike belays. 2. 35m - 5b. Climb wide crack to top of block. Traverse left across block to corner. Move around left edge of corner and gain a narrow ramp on face. Move up this a few feet until possible to climb onto sloping ledge above (crux).Climb steep corner above ledge and pull out right and gain top with an awkward mantelshelf. Scramble up 6m. for a nut and peg belay. Little Bitchitis 110m VS 4c 1) First pitch as for crusade 2) 4c- 20m climb up the wide crack to the top of the block and arrange protection. From the top of the block make an airy traverse to the right. Continue more easily upwards to a large grass ledge and belay. 3) 3c - 30m climb upwards to below the head wall. Traverse leftwards below the headwall until you can pull around its far left edge. belay at the large blocks. 4) 15m climb easily up the slab to the top. GRANUAILE 114m S Clare Sheridan, Bairbre Sheridan. 14.6.75 Start by scrambling to obvious crack below a dark overhanging groove, right of the high white wall, left of a large boulder with overhanging roof. 1. 36m. Climb crack and continue to below overhanging groove. Move left and around nose onto large slab. Belay at left (peg) (or up vegetated ramp). 2 18m. Climb short corner and continue up veg. for a few feet. Step right onto a white wall and climb to ledge (coincides with upper part of pitch (3) of Great Western). Nut belay below overhang. 3. 42m. Step up and left to surmount overhang and continue straight up on easier ground, bearing right round overhangs (loose blocks). Choice of belays. 4. 18m. Climb easily and directly to top. Joss' Fault 62m S Joss Lynam, Bob Richardson (shared leads). 14.6.75 This goes up the rather obvious fault line which forms an incipient chimney in the nose about 20m. right of the white wall. Start at the foot of the fault. 1. 27m. Follow the line of the fault, mostly keeping to the right into a niche (pitch could be broken here). Climb up the slightly overhanging chimney above (crux) to a ledge on the left. Go up diagonally, right round the overhang to a terrace. Go up a further 4m. on vegetation to a wire chock belay. Beware of loose blocks on this pitch. 2. 35m. Climb the big slabby steps left of the impending wall. At about 20m. go left over a small wall into a big recess with an overhanging roof. Exit by the left wall and move up right to belays. To the left of the First Pinnacle Buttress is a smaller buttress. Left of centre on this is a big corner formed between a steep slab and a somewhat overhanging wall. There is an overhang across the top of the slab. The climb goes up the layback crack in the corner, then traverses left to a narrow vertical crack in the slab. NATASHA 30m VS 1. 22m. Reach the foot of the layback crack with some difficulty. Layback up to big overhang (moss on slab). Chock runner. Make a slightly descending traverse to the crack. Climb the crack jamming (crux) and exit left to a big ledge. 2. 8m. Traverse left along grassy ledge and climb the easy corner by bridging. </div> Moving left again, from 'Natasha' approx 50m, is an obvious pinnacle with a massive fallen block at its peak, the next climb starts at the outwards face of the pinnacle, below a hanging , curving crack line. SLITHER 20m HS 4b Clem Quinn, Carl Maddox. 14.3.14 1. 10m. 4a/b (Start right side of Pinnacle) Reach the foot of the curving hanging crack via large sloping ledges. From top of crack, make a high step up and left, the make a rising traverse on sloping ledges to large 'Gap' belay. 2. 10m. 4a/b Straight up to steep wall, then Traverse right, along exposed ledge to reach the inside of the pinnacle. Make a tricky traverse to reach the fallen block and pull steeply over this to finish. Descent - Cross fallen block to exit. Note: This route was climbed in drizzle, so wet holds and smears made the final grade hard to judge. 'Natsha' looks like a classic, steep line - hopefully a dry day on our next visit. ==SLIEVEMORE BUTTRESS== At the head of the valley on the north face of Slievemore is a prominent pear-shaped slabby buttress 1 hr. from the road THE SNEAKER 114m S N.

ELEGANT ELEPHANT VD 12m Climb the obvious crack to the right o the platform. Kieran Wilson, Helen Bradley, Pat Rodgers, 9/9/94. ==SLIEVEMORE== Around 15 routes ranging from long easy and accessible slab climbing to more mountain style climbs topping out on the Slievemore ridge. Some of the shorter slab climbs start above steep, grassy approaches so an abseil might offer a more relaxed and logical approach, albeit missing the original adventure of grass and heather belays. A bit of cleaning would bring plenty of new route potential and the current climbs such as Natasha VS and Bitch out Route E2 offer good example's of the climbing quality.

Escape Route Diff 30m The easiest route up cracks and blocks right of hailstone corner to a breech left of a small pinnacle. Scramble up arête to finish. East of Waterfall Cove, Dingo Area Facing the open sea around the arête is a square non tidal ledge. In good weather this is a real suntrap. It can be reached by traversing round from Waterfall cove, down climbing Touché Turtle or by abseil (72). 19. Touché Turtle * Diff 30m Climb the scoop just left of Suntrap ledge. Continue up easy angled corner to arête. Up this as for Escape Route. (73). 20. Levon Helm * E1 (5c) 30m Climbs the corner at the back of suntrap ledge. Technical moves to gain groove, finish more easily up right edge of slab Alt finish, Place protection on right of slab, traverse left 2 meters to finish directly up centre of slab (5b) (74). 21. Gleaning the Crumbs * HVS (5b) 20m From the right edge of suntrap ledge. Up short rightwards leading slab then back left through overhang. Easy ground to top. (75). 22. Dingo ** S (4a) 25m Traverse right from ledge across a chimney to the next wall. Take the crack up the middle of this wall. Excellent situations for the grade, maybe safer to abseil into hanging belay (76). 23. Indian Summer * S (4a) 25m Takes the arête forming the right edge of Dingo wall. Traverse or abseil to hanging belay just left of arête. Traverse right to arête, up arête (No protection for 4 meters) and continue direct to easier ground above East of Waterfall Cove, Achill Slab and Fair Dinkum Area The next two routes start from a platform beneath an intimidating overhanging wall right of Dingo. The platform can be reached by abseil or by down climbing Achill Slab. (77). 24. Achill Slab S (3c) 20m The slab that forms the left boundary of the large overhanging wall and lies to the right of the wall Dingo is situated on (78). 25. Zawn Chorus HVS (4c) 25m Take a slanting right to left line of weakness which becomes a chimney. At 12 meters traverse left across a well hung slab (often damp) to exposed ledge. Up sandy corner above, finishing out left of capstone. Poor rock at top needs to be cleaned (the last 2m were top roped) Right of the overhanging wall is a smooth, bulging arête and then a deep cut chimney/ zawn. Right again are three routes. These can be easily reached by descending gentle slabs further to the east and traversing round. This is around 50m east of Waterfall Cove (79). 26. Achilldorightly * V.Diff 15m The stepped corner 6m right of the deep cut chimney/ zawn. Take the line of least resistance and finish entertainingly wide chimney Direct finish, VS (4c) 15m.

ELEGANT ELEPHANT VD 12m Climb the obvious crack to the right o the platform. Kieran Wilson, Helen Bradley, Pat Rodgers, 9/9/94. ==SLIEVEMORE== Around 15 routes ranging from long easy and accessible slab climbing to more mountain style climbs topping out on the Slievemore ridge. Some of the shorter slab climbs start above steep, grassy approaches so an abseil might offer a more relaxed and logical approach, albeit missing the original adventure of grass and heather belays. A bit of cleaning would bring plenty of new route potential and the current climbs such as Natasha VS and Bitch out Route E2 offer good example's of the climbing quality. Diff 2 Routes V Diff 2 Routes Severe 5 Routes HS 1 Route VS 3 Routes HVS 1 Route E2 1 Route ==DUGORT SLABS== The lowest two crags on the North West Flank of Slievemore Ridge, 15 mins. walk from Dugort Quay Road.

Scramble along rough ground below the crag until an obvious pink slab comes into view. This is: PINKIE 35m Diff Joss Lynam, Lesley Richardson. 15.6.75 Start on a rib barely emerging from the heather, to the left, and below the slab. 1. 25m. Climb onto the slab and go straight up to a big recess. 2. 10m. Climb the wall on the right in a corner. Beyond Pinkie are a number of short slabs and corners of insufficient sustained interest to be worth recording. Near the right hand end of the crag is a vertical rib. This is: SALAMANDER 22m Severe 4a Carl Maddox, Jason Ryan 11.05.08 The obvious hanging slab half way between Pinkee and Production line. Scramble up grassy ledges to vegetated corner/ wall below and right of the clean hanging slab. (Abseil approach maybe easier). Move up and trend left on on vegetated rock to overhanging block, move left round block then step right to grass ledge. Traverse left along huge block and crack to slab base. Directly up clean well featured slab to finish. Right of Salamander and left of the rib start of Production line, is another hanging slab, with a large overhang at its base, the next climb starts below the right side of the slab and overhangs. Best approached by abseil. AMPHIBIAN 20m Severe 4a (Possibly HS 4a due to bold section) Carl Maddox, Neal McAloon 01.08.10 Take the broken rock and vegetation just right of overhangs.

Climb a short corner on the left of the ledge, and the fine white wall to a good stance. Nut and piton belay. 4. 33m. Move right 3m. and climb the overlap and the short groove above, step left on grass and make a rising traverse to the right, to an obvious brown corner, climb this and step right at the top to a good stance. Piton belay below a big overlap. 5. 22m. Pad up the narrowing slab to the right and where the slab ends make a difficult mantle shelf. Ascend to the roof and traverse pleasantly left to finish up at a short steep wall, on the ridge. CRUSADE 80m HVS The route below takes the obvious diagonal line of narrow ramps and slabs up the North face of the First Pinnacle Buttress and finishes up a steep corner high on the left side of the face. Start as for Great Western, i.e. at the foot of the nose where the north and west faces meet. 1. 45m - 4c. Climb leftwards up the ramp on the side of the semi-detached block, and across the top of a corner to a good stance and possible belay. (Great Western goes straight up from here). Move left on slab and pull around the corner. Descend slightly and step across groove to gain slab on left with difficulty. Move up to crack, and up this a few feet until possible to traverse left across wall to a good foot ledge below the leftward trending narrow slab (the slab is split by a thin crack). Climb slab and continue up narrow ramps to a grass ledge beneath a wide crack. Peg and spike belays. 2. 35m - 5b. Climb wide crack to top of block. Traverse left across block to corner. Move around left edge of corner and gain a narrow ramp on face. Move up this a few feet until possible to climb onto sloping ledge above (crux).Climb steep corner above ledge and pull out right and gain top with an awkward mantelshelf. Scramble up 6m. for a nut and peg belay. Little Bitchitis 110m VS 4c 1) First pitch as for crusade 2) 4c- 20m climb up the wide crack to the top of the block and arrange protection.

Joss' Fault 62m S Joss Lynam, Bob Richardson (shared leads). 14.6.75 This goes up the rather obvious fault line which forms an incipient chimney in the nose about 20m. right of the white wall. Start at the foot of the fault. 1. 27m. Follow the line of the fault, mostly keeping to the right into a niche (pitch could be broken here). Climb up the slightly overhanging chimney above (crux) to a ledge on the left. Go up diagonally, right round the overhang to a terrace. Go up a further 4m. on vegetation to a wire chock belay. Beware of loose blocks on this pitch. 2. 35m. Climb the big slabby steps left of the impending wall. At about 20m. go left over a small wall into a big recess with an overhanging roof. Exit by the left wall and move up right to belays. To the left of the First Pinnacle Buttress is a smaller buttress. Left of centre on this is a big corner formed between a steep slab and a somewhat overhanging wall. There is an overhang across the top of the slab. The climb goes up the layback crack in the corner, then traverses left to a narrow vertical crack in the slab. NATASHA 30m VS 1. 22m. Reach the foot of the layback crack with some difficulty. Layback up to big overhang (moss on slab). Chock runner. Make a slightly descending traverse to the crack. Climb the crack jamming (crux) and exit left to a big ledge. 2. 8m. Traverse left along grassy ledge and climb the easy corner by bridging. </div> Moving left again, from 'Natasha' approx 50m, is an obvious pinnacle with a massive fallen block at its peak, the next climb starts at the outwards face of the pinnacle, below a hanging , curving crack line. SLITHER 20m HS 4b Clem Quinn, Carl Maddox. 14.3.14 1. 10m. 4a/b (Start right side of Pinnacle) Reach the foot of the curving hanging crack via large sloping ledges.

Make a tricky traverse to reach the fallen block and pull steeply over this to finish. Descent - Cross fallen block to exit. Note: This route was climbed in drizzle, so wet holds and smears made the final grade hard to judge. 'Natsha' looks like a classic, steep line - hopefully a dry day on our next visit. ==SLIEVEMORE BUTTRESS== At the head of the valley on the north face of Slievemore is a prominent pear-shaped slabby buttress 1 hr. from the road THE SNEAKER 114m S N.

Kieran Wilson, Helen Bradley, Pat Rodgers, 9/9/94. ==SLIEVEMORE== Around 15 routes ranging from long easy and accessible slab climbing to more mountain style climbs topping out on the Slievemore ridge. Some of the shorter slab climbs start above steep, grassy approaches so an abseil might offer a more relaxed and logical approach, albeit missing the original adventure of grass and heather belays. A bit of cleaning would bring plenty of new route potential and the current climbs such as Natasha VS and Bitch out Route E2 offer good example's of the climbing quality.

Kieran Wilson, Helen Bradley, Pat Rodgers, 9/9/94. ==SLIEVEMORE== Around 15 routes ranging from long easy and accessible slab climbing to more mountain style climbs topping out on the Slievemore ridge. Some of the shorter slab climbs start above steep, grassy approaches so an abseil might offer a more relaxed and logical approach, albeit missing the original adventure of grass and heather belays. A bit of cleaning would bring plenty of new route potential and the current climbs such as Natasha VS and Bitch out Route E2 offer good example's of the climbing quality.

Kieran Wilson, Helen Bradley, Pat Rodgers, 9/9/94. ==SLIEVEMORE== Around 15 routes ranging from long easy and accessible slab climbing to more mountain style climbs topping out on the Slievemore ridge. Some of the shorter slab climbs start above steep, grassy approaches so an abseil might offer a more relaxed and logical approach, albeit missing the original adventure of grass and heather belays. A bit of cleaning would bring plenty of new route potential and the current climbs such as Natasha VS and Bitch out Route E2 offer good example's of the climbing quality.

Make a tricky traverse to reach the fallen block and pull steeply over this to finish. Descent - Cross fallen block to exit. Note: This route was climbed in drizzle, so wet holds and smears made the final grade hard to judge. 'Natsha' looks like a classic, steep line - hopefully a dry day on our next visit. ==SLIEVEMORE BUTTRESS== At the head of the valley on the north face of Slievemore is a prominent pear-shaped slabby buttress 1 hr. from the road THE SNEAKER 114m S N.

Climb up the slightly overhanging chimney above (crux) to a ledge on the left. Go up diagonally, right round the overhang to a terrace. Go up a further 4m. on vegetation to a wire chock belay. Beware of loose blocks on this pitch. 2. 35m. Climb the big slabby steps left of the impending wall. At about 20m. go left over a small wall into a big recess with an overhanging roof. Exit by the left wall and move up right to belays. To the left of the First Pinnacle Buttress is a smaller buttress. Left of centre on this is a big corner formed between a steep slab and a somewhat overhanging wall. There is an overhang across the top of the slab. The climb goes up the layback crack in the corner, then traverses left to a narrow vertical crack in the slab. NATASHA 30m VS 1. 22m. Reach the foot of the layback crack with some difficulty.

Quality climbing, great sea views and varied wildlife are all part of the mix. The sea cliff climbing in Achill is on well weathered and featured Daldradian Quartzite, Meta-sediments and Conglomerates. The climbs so far are mainly in the lower to mid grades, and some of the really stand out routes tend to be in the Severe to HVS range. As a general rule the rock offers excellent friction, good protection and very clean distinct lines. The climbs have an adventurous feel, often striking out directly above the sea, most requiring abseil access and often hanging belay stances. Whilst some routes are more easily accessible, parties should be well organized and competent in sea cliff access. The ground, scrambling out above the tops of some routes requires care due to some looser capping layers in parts. It is worth leaving abseil ropes in place for Belays and to protect the exit from routes. The climbs particularly around Waterfall cove top out on steep grass or looser rock, so escape ropes should be left in place in this top section for safety, along with Prussiks. Main Belay points are sometimes just below these grassy/ rocky top outs and this should be noted for the area your climbing in. Use of helmets is strongly advised. Sea conditions can be rough, at times requiring a high belay point to avoid spray and large waves. Once orientated and comfortable with the approach, Achill offers high quality climbing, covering a whole variety of situations and techniques. New routes are easily found, with scope for a huge number of lines at all grades. To get the best from each area and make the most from each visit, a good approach is to pick a section of cliff for the day, set your abseil and get as many lines ticked in this area as possible before moving on. 800px Main Approach From Achill Sound take main R319 for approx 17km to Keel. Then onto Dooagh (3km). Stay on R319 towards Keem bay Use Parking Area A For access to: Foher, Waterfall Cove, Mweelaun Rocks and Carrickmore Point Parking Area A Cars can be left at a lay-by on the right of the road leading to Keem. Park just before the turn off to the water board plant. From here a short walk south east brings you to Waterfall cove (see crag entry) Approach to other cliff sections in this area are described in relation to Waterfall cove. Parking Area B From parking area A, continue towards Keem on R319 for around 1km. Park at Grassy lay-by on left. This lay-by is found as road reaches its highest point and just before the road dips and bends to the right around a major gully line <display_map> </display_map> 800px Image:Achill_Locations_Guide_P1_.jpg ==Far West - Long Walk Area== A new area between Keem beach and the Big blue area was explored. There seems to be scope for a small number of routes here, including an impressive hanging corner, which was too wet to try on our visit, and a reasonable looking shorter wall. Approach to this area starts from parking area B. From the parking area B, walk along the road towards Keem bay. Passing two major and steep gully systems until a third gully reached. This Gully is easy angled and straight forward to walk into, follow this third gully down to its base. As you stand facing the sea, turn and head left to a large, obvious rock pinnacle, that has a distinct crack running on its right wall. This is: The Long Walk * Severe 4a 22m (+ 38m Scramble) Follow the obvious crack on right side of the rock pinnacle, passing small overhangs at half height(crux),finish directly up capping slabs.

Climb wall direct, taking care with the thinner (avoidable) holds. This cove has a small sea stack in its centre and good parking just above it. There are three inlets opposite the sea stack. Scramble easily down into the southern inlet. A huge white wall with an obvious crack running the full height is the first feature.

            "description": "Cleaned hanging groove / corner near right hand side of crag, ==Doo Lough - Upper Crag== The crag is located directly above the northern end of Doo Lough (L 686 824 OS .5\" map sheet 10) and can be seen from the road. It is approached by walking along the northern shore of the lake and then up a murderous grassy slope for about 300m. (about 45 minutes). The crag is composed of several buttresses of sandstone, conglomerate and a hard red rock which is possibly volcanic ash (?). Its height ranges from 90 - 60m. The rock is a bit fragile in places, but the climbing is good quality. The routes are described from left to right. The exact details of IRELAND WALL and KNIGHT'S MOVE are not known. The part of IRELAND WALL reminiscent of the map of Ireland is a fairly small scale feature, at about 20m, and it should be pretty obvious. IRELAND WALL S KNIGHT'S MOVE Diff (1) AILILL 13m E1 5b This climb is found on the most easterly of the smooth buttresses. Protection is not so good. Start at a steep groove - crackline near the right hand end of the buttress. Up the groove to steepening rock. Bridge up to gain a blocky hold on the right, 2m. from the top. Move delicately left to a wide crack and finish. (2) VOYAGER 42m VS 4c Start above and slightly to the right of Ailill at a large flake. Climb up onto the flake and follow the crack-line directly up the wall to steepening rock and the crux. Finish on good holds. Belay on a block some distance to the left and hard to find Left of the main face there is a small triangular buttress of superb smooth reddish rock. It is separated from the main face by a grassy gully. To the right of the buttress there is a large rocky gully which usually has a waterfall. The routes on this buttress are among the finest on the crag. (3) BRAGELA's WATCH 100m E1 An excellent climb with a real mountain atmosphere. Start to the east of the crag beneath a tall, steep, narrow buttress, just right of a major gully running up the hillside - about 20m. left of Nightrider. 1. 30m, 5b. Climb the left face of the buttress to a ledge (micro-wires) and then climb a steep ramp on the left of the buttress with increasing difficulty to a flake crack. Up more easily to a belay. 2. 20m, 3c. Move up rightwards to a grassy niche, and then left on a rock nose. Follow grass to belay at the base of a steep arête. 3. 30m, 5a. Climb up the arête passing a short vertical wall on the right. Continue up slightly right to grass ledge and back to a belay. 4. 20m, 3c. Move up right and then left via a ramp to easy ground and belay some distance to the right. (4) RED DAWN 25m E2 5c Another excellent and sustained climb with good protection. It takes the right hand of two cracks on the left side of the buttress. Approaching from the left make a difficult sequence of moves to gain the crack. Follow this to a difficult bulge to the top. Abseil off to the left. (5) LETTER TO BRESHNEV 30m E3/4 6a This excellent and serious route starts up a shallow groove near to the right side of the buttress. Bridge precariously up the sustained groove to a good peg at 10m. Make a difficult traverse right to large holds. Continue straight up past a poor peg to a crack leading left near the top. Follow this leftwards for 5m. to a short thin crack that leads to the top of the smooth face. Climb a slender pillar of rock above to a belay in a chimney on the left just under the top of the buttress. A superb sustained face climb. The following routes are all in the region of the main face, which is an impressive, relatively smooth sheet of rock about 45m. high, the highest buttress on the crag. It has a broad base but tapers towards the top. The right side of the face is a well defined arête with a deep grassy groove on its right. To the left of the face there is a detached buttress of smooth reddish rock. Left again there is a deep slimy gully with a waterfall. The best approach to the area is by following a vague sheep track contouring up over the NW side of Doo Lough to a broad scree filled gully extending down from the crag. Follow the left edge of the gully (about 45 minutes from the road). The starts of most routes are marked by small cairns. The climbs are generally good quality but care is required on some due to the brittle nature of the rock and poor protection. The crag is in a magnificent setting high above the lake with extensive views of mountains and Clew Bay. (6) EARTH WATCH 70m E1/2 Two contrasting pitches to the left of the main face. The first takes a short fragile looking wall sandwiched between the main face, a wide grassy gully on the left and a grassy terrace above. The second pitch takes a superb line up a prominent corner with overhangs on the upper left side of the main face. Start below the centre of the short wall at a shallow groove. 1. 30m. 5b. Make a difficult move up the groove to reach brittle flakes which lead to good holds near the top of the face (no. 6 rock sideways at 10m.). Pull precariously over grass and scramble up the terrace to a large blocky belay below the prominent corner (a serious pitch) 2. 40m. 5b. The corner is initially bulging. Climb this section on large holds. Continue up traversing under two overhangs to a third overhang. Climb over this using a wide crack to the top of the buttress. Scramble up heathery slopes to a spike belay. An excellent pitch on solid rock. It can be reached more easily and safely by starting up the first pitch of Nightrider, reducing the overall grade to E1. (7) NIGHTRIDER 70m E1/2 5b/c The crag is dominated by a large triangular face bounded on its right side by a deep grassy groove. This route takes a line up the left-hand side of the face. Start in the middle of the face. 1. 25m. 5b. Climb steeply up the wall to a left-trending diagonal crack. Follow this to a gully on the left side of the face. Continue up the left edge of the face until it is possible to move left into the gully. Block belay on the left at the top of the gully. 2. 45m. 5b/c. Traverse right for 7m. back onto the face (crux) to a crack. Climb the crack in a superb position to easy ground. Scramble up trending slightly right to a spike belay near the top. Escape off the cliff by first scrambling up leftwards and then up rightwards along a grassy ramp. (8) CHINA BEACH 60m E2 Takes zigzag cracks up the right side of the main face. A serious route due to sustained climbing on brittle rock and less than perfect protection. Start under the centre of the face just right of the start of Nightrider. 1. 20m. 5a. Climb steeply up to a narrow ledge. Continue up just left of a large sheet of smooth white rock to another narrow ledge below a thin crack. Make an uncomfortable belay on this ledge using a nut and a No. 1 Friend 3m. higher. 2. 40m. 5b. Climb the crack and move right to gain a long prominent left trending crack. Ascent to the top of the crack and move right to a right trending crack (No. 4 Friend) which is followed to the right arête of the face. Climb the arête which leads to scrambling and a poor spike belay. (9) SOLITAIRE 55m HS This route follows the prominent grassy groove that bounds the right side of the main face. Although heavily vegetated in the groove the climbing is entirely on solid rock. Start directly below the groove. Initially climb just left of the groove, then bridge across the vegetation until it gets slightly steeper at mid-height. Make a delicate move up the left slab of the groove to a ledge. Continue up to a steeper finish to gain the top right arête of the main face. Scramble up to the top of the buttress. (10) ON REFLECTION 115m VS 4b,4c,4b A good mountain route with good interest throughout. 1. 4b, 55m Start as for Solitaire, follow the major corner and arete feature as for Solitaire, to large block belay. A good pitch on solid rock with some bold climbing on the central section. (If in doubt trick your climbing buddy into leading this pitch) 2. 4c, 30m An Excellent varied pitch, well protected. Cross the grass ramp, move up and right to a steep wall and finger crack, (left of blocky section) Climb finger crack for 6 meters (crux) to ledge. Up on blocky ground trending left then right to obvious steep corner, superb bridging up corner to grass ledge and belay 3. 20m 4b, Drop down ramp for a few meters to next wall. Follow slab and corner for 10m, move left to steep wall, directly up this taking care with the rock to belay at massive boulder. (10 a) Direct Finish P3. 5a/b 20m Nads Direct To the right of the slab and corner, head directly to the clean, obvious overhang. Place good cam protection in the overhang / roof, and make hard, strenuous moves right to gain the ramp. Traverse right along ramp to central crack, and finish delicately, straight up. A well protected challenge, crux high in the grade. (11) DICTATOR 75m E1 5b,4b The central and highest part of the crag is dominated by an impressive 45m. wall. This is bordered on the right by a deep grassy groove. Right of this there is an obvious thin diagonal crack trending leftwards up a steep slab(!). Start below a shallow corner at the bottom of the crack and about 9m. right of the deep grassy groove. The first pitch offers tremendous climbing. 1. 42m. 5b. Climb steeply up the corner to a ledge on the right at about 6m. Move left and continue easily up the crack to where it steepens at about 18m. Avoid the crack by following a line of holds on the left wall to a minute overlap. Traverse back right into the thin crack and up this (crux) to a second and larger overlap. Hand traverse down leftwards under the overlap for about 5m. and up to a small ledge. Climb diagonally rightwards to a confined grassy belay stance directly above the crack line. 2. 33m. 4b. Move left, firstly on grass and then rock to a small overlap. Over this and up a shallow groove for about 6m. At the top of the groove traverse right for about 5m. and pull up onto vegetation. Scramble up to an obvious short leftward-trending groove and up this to the top. Good nut belay (large hex.) about 9m. up the grassy ramp that forms the top of the buttress. The next three climbs are found close together in the centre of the crag left and right of a recessed zone of black rock. The first begins on the right side of a steep buttress left of the seepage zone. (12) BANBA 28M HVS 4c Climb a steep ramp to a grass ledge and belay. (13) DARK WATERS 56m VS Start just right of the seepage zone below a steep buttress and 2m. left of the start of Heuston Blues. 1. 28m, 4c. Up the narrowing ramp and crack to a grass ledge and a belay. 2. 28m, 4c. Up slabby rock to a grass ledge. Climb steepening rock to a bulge and finish. (The second pitch may be the top section of Heuston Blues) (14) HEUSTON BLUES 30m VS 4b About 273m. from the right end of the crag there is an area of black and often wet rock with a long 1m. wide overhang 9m's. up. This route climbs a zigzag crack line on the buttress right of the black rock. Start just right of a gully between the two buttresses at the bottom of a rightward-trending crack. Traverse rightwards along the crack to another crack slanting up leftwards. Climb this to a ledge at mid-height. Continue over a small bulge and hence up an easy crack to the top. (15) LAIRGREN 48m VS Start 75m. right of Dark Waters at a ramp - a few metres left of Blue Movie. 1. 23m, 4b. Climb the leftwards sloping ramp to a ledge and block belay. 2. 25m,4c. Climb up steeply and slightly left via discontinuous cracks to a ledge. Up again slightly left via a knobbly slab to steeper rock beneath a triangular niche. Climb up on smallish holds (crux) and finish up a gentle slab to belay. (16) BLUE MOVIE 36m S This climb follows an obvious blue-stained leftward-trending ramp about 30m. right of Heuston Blues. 1. 18m. Climb the ramp to a grassy ledge and belay. 2. 18m. Move left and follow a leftward-trending crack to a grassy ledge. Trend rightwards up a fine short wall of rough conglomerate. Poor protection. (17) PIONEER 20m E2 5c Takes a thin crack-line up the wall just right of the ramp of Blue Movie. Start directly below the crack. Scramble up to a grassy ledge at 3m. Trend right up the wall into the thin crack and up this (crux) to a large flake at mid-height. Continue awkwardly up the wider left-trending crack above to the top. Good climbing. (18) VOYAGER 20m E1 5b About 10m. right of Blue Movie there is a narrow left-trending ramp. Start under this. Climb the ramp for 5m. Step left onto small holds and climb steeply to larger holds. There is a poor flake runner out to the left. Continue up the wall, past a poor spike runner to regain the ramp which is followed to the top. Good climbing, though poorly protected. (19) AIFE 53m HVS A short but demanding and exciting first pitch. Start at a steep right-trending crack 50m. right of Lairgren. 1. 18m,5a/b. Climb crack (sustained but with good protection to a small ledge and then left for 5m. to a block belay. 2. 35m, 3c. Continue up the arête to easy ground. (20) IOLAR 40m VS Start 5m. right of Aife and 3m left of a dirty corner. 1. 28m, 3c. Up onto the arête to a large block and grassy ledge. Belay behind a large block at the base of the chimney. 2. 12m, 4c. Up the chimney and crack to an overhanging jammed block which is passed on the left with care. The following three climbs are located on the buttress near the right end of the crag. The buttress is characterized by two obvious wide cracks, one trending left and the other right. They meet some distance above the ground. Below the cracks there is a mossy area of rock: (21) COLUMBIA 21m VS 4c This route takes the left-hand crack mentioned above. Start at a broken crack just left of the mossy rock and about 2m. right of the gully forming the left-hand boundary of the buttress. Climb diagonally rightwards for about 5m. Ascend the thin jagged crack above to a niche in the wide crack at mid-height. Continue up the leftward-trending crack to the top. (22)WINGS 21m HVS 5b Start below a thin faint and red ramp about 9m. right of Columbia. Climb the ramp until further progress becomes difficult near the top. Traverse right across the wall to a crack and up this easily to the top. (Excellent sustained climbing.) (23) BEETLE This route takes a rightward-trending crack which starts just right of Wings. Climb the crack to the top. Scramble up to a block belay. (24) ARDAN 42m S 4a Start 3m. right of Beetle. 1. 20m. Up via niches to the arête and follow this to a ledge and belay. 2. 22m. Continue up easier ground to finish. (25) AINNLE 10m HVS 5a Unimpressive looking but probably worth it for the crux. Start right of Ardan at a small cave. Climb up to beneath the overhang, move left and gain the crack strenuously. Continue up more easily to the top. (26) BARACH 13m S 3c Start to the right of Ainnle. At a small buttress in a recess above the blockfield. Climb the arête on the left of the buttress passing the overhang (crux). (27) BRANWEN 13m V.Diff Start just right of Barach. Climb up the centre of the buttress past an overlap. (28) GUAIRE 47m HVS Start right of an obvious descent gully at a small, steep, smooth faced buttress. 1. 12m, 5a. Climb the centre of the buttress to the top treating the rock with care. Poor protection. 2. 35m, 3c. Climb the wall above on its left side directly to easy ground and belay. (29) CLIONA's WAVE 20m VS 4b Start near the western end of the crag just right of a grassy gully and directly above three obvious boulders. Climb the corner to dubious blocks and move right beneath an overhang. Gain height and move delicately left to the top of the overhang. Then move easily to the top. These routes lie on the cliffs above the south-west end of the lake at Doolough. The most striking buttress here is subtended by a Y-shaped gully. Ascend the rib on the left of the stem of the Y and then traverse onto the face of the buttress above the vegetated portion. The face above has two roughly parallel cracks and a smaller one on the extreme edge. Two routes were taken up the face. UNNAMED 1 45m V.Diff This route starts up the left-hand crack. 1. 15m. Take the start of the left crack but pull out right up a sloping slab leading right back to the top of a pedestal in the middle of the face. 2. 15m. Take the right crack to ledge - caution with projecting blocks. Up groove to overhang. Traverse right to belay. 3. 15m. Take easy groove above to top. UNNAMED 2 55m MS The right-hand crack starts just to the right of a pedestal in the middle of the face. This route starts just to the right of this pedestal and initially takes a line up the face to the right of the right crack, but ends up to the left of the previous climb. 1. 30m. Straight up to belay at the end of the second pitch of Unnamed 1."

            "description": "IRELAND WALL S KNIGHT'S MOVE Diff (1) AILILL 13m E1 5b This climb is found on the most easterly of the smooth buttresses. Protection is not so good. Start at a steep groove - crackline near the right hand end of the buttress. Up the groove to steepening rock. Bridge up to gain a blocky hold on the right, 2m. from the top. Move delicately left to a wide crack and finish. (2) VOYAGER 42m VS 4c Start above and slightly to the right of Ailill at a large flake. Climb up onto the flake and follow the crack-line directly up the wall to steepening rock and the crux. Finish on good holds. Belay on a block some distance to the left and hard to find Left of the main face there is a small triangular buttress of superb smooth reddish rock. It is separated from the main face by a grassy gully. To the right of the buttress there is a large rocky gully which usually has a waterfall. The routes on this buttress are among the finest on the crag. (3) BRAGELA's WATCH 100m E1 An excellent climb with a real mountain atmosphere. Start to the east of the crag beneath a tall, steep, narrow buttress, just right of a major gully running up the hillside - about 20m. left of Nightrider. 1. 30m, 5b. Climb the left face of the buttress to a ledge (micro-wires) and then climb a steep ramp on the left of the buttress with increasing difficulty to a flake crack. Up more easily to a belay. 2. 20m, 3c. Move up rightwards to a grassy niche, and then left on a rock nose. Follow grass to belay at the base of a steep arête. 3. 30m, 5a. Climb up the arête passing a short vertical wall on the right. Continue up slightly right to grass ledge and back to a belay. 4. 20m, 3c. Move up right and then left via a ramp to easy ground and belay some distance to the right. (4) RED DAWN 25m E2 5c Another excellent and sustained climb with good protection. It takes the right hand of two cracks on the left side of the buttress. Approaching from the left make a difficult sequence of moves to gain the crack. Follow this to a difficult bulge to the top. Abseil off to the left. (5) LETTER TO BRESHNEV 30m E3/4 6a This excellent and serious route starts up a shallow groove near to the right side of the buttress. Bridge precariously up the sustained groove to a good peg at 10m. Make a difficult traverse right to large holds. Continue straight up past a poor peg to a crack leading left near the top. Follow this leftwards for 5m. to a short thin crack that leads to the top of the smooth face. Climb a slender pillar of rock above to a belay in a chimney on the left just under the top of the buttress. A superb sustained face climb. The following routes are all in the region of the main face, which is an impressive, relatively smooth sheet of rock about 45m. high, the highest buttress on the crag. It has a broad base but tapers towards the top. The right side of the face is a well defined arête with a deep grassy groove on its right. To the left of the face there is a detached buttress of smooth reddish rock. Left again there is a deep slimy gully with a waterfall. The best approach to the area is by following a vague sheep track contouring up over the NW side of Doo Lough to a broad scree filled gully extending down from the crag. Follow the left edge of the gully (about 45 minutes from the road). The starts of most routes are marked by small cairns. The climbs are generally good quality but care is required on some due to the brittle nature of the rock and poor protection. The crag is in a magnificent setting high above the lake with extensive views of mountains and Clew Bay. (6) EARTH WATCH 70m E1/2 Two contrasting pitches to the left of the main face. The first takes a short fragile looking wall sandwiched between the main face, a wide grassy gully on the left and a grassy terrace above. The second pitch takes a superb line up a prominent corner with overhangs on the upper left side of the main face. Start below the centre of the short wall at a shallow groove. 1. 30m. 5b. Make a difficult move up the groove to reach brittle flakes which lead to good holds near the top of the face (no. 6 rock sideways at 10m.). Pull precariously over grass and scramble up the terrace to a large blocky belay below the prominent corner (a serious pitch) 2. 40m. 5b. The corner is initially bulging. Climb this section on large holds. Continue up traversing under two overhangs to a third overhang. Climb over this using a wide crack to the top of the buttress. Scramble up heathery slopes to a spike belay. An excellent pitch on solid rock. It can be reached more easily and safely by starting up the first pitch of Nightrider, reducing the overall grade to E1. (7) NIGHTRIDER 70m E1/2 5b/c The crag is dominated by a large triangular face bounded on its right side by a deep grassy groove. This route takes a line up the left-hand side of the face. Start in the middle of the face. 1. 25m. 5b. Climb steeply up the wall to a left-trending diagonal crack. Follow this to a gully on the left side of the face. Continue up the left edge of the face until it is possible to move left into the gully. Block belay on the left at the top of the gully. 2. 45m. 5b/c. Traverse right for 7m. back onto the face (crux) to a crack. Climb the crack in a superb position to easy ground. Scramble up trending slightly right to a spike belay near the top. Escape off the cliff by first scrambling up leftwards and then up rightwards along a grassy ramp. (8) CHINA BEACH 60m E2 Takes zigzag cracks up the right side of the main face. A serious route due to sustained climbing on brittle rock and less than perfect protection. Start under the centre of the face just right of the start of Nightrider. 1. 20m. 5a. Climb steeply up to a narrow ledge. Continue up just left of a large sheet of smooth white rock to another narrow ledge below a thin crack. Make an uncomfortable belay on this ledge using a nut and a No. 1 Friend 3m. higher. 2. 40m. 5b. Climb the crack and move right to gain a long prominent left trending crack. Ascent to the top of the crack and move right to a right trending crack (No. 4 Friend) which is followed to the right arête of the face. Climb the arête which leads to scrambling and a poor spike belay. (9) SOLITAIRE 55m HS This route follows the prominent grassy groove that bounds the right side of the main face. Although heavily vegetated in the groove the climbing is entirely on solid rock. Start directly below the groove. Initially climb just left of the groove, then bridge across the vegetation until it gets slightly steeper at mid-height. Make a delicate move up the left slab of the groove to a ledge. Continue up to a steeper finish to gain the top right arête of the main face. Scramble up to the top of the buttress. (10) ON REFLECTION 115m VS 4b,4c,4b A good mountain route with good interest throughout. 1. 4b, 55m Start as for Solitaire, follow the major corner and arete feature as for Solitaire, to large block belay. A good pitch on solid rock with some bold climbing on the central section. (If in doubt trick your climbing buddy into leading this pitch) 2. 4c, 30m An Excellent varied pitch, well protected. Cross the grass ramp, move up and right to a steep wall and finger crack, (left of blocky section) Climb finger crack for 6 meters (crux) to ledge. Up on blocky ground trending left then right to obvious steep corner, superb bridging up corner to grass ledge and belay 3. 20m 4b, Drop down ramp for a few meters to next wall. Follow slab and corner for 10m, move left to steep wall, directly up this taking care with the rock to belay at massive boulder. (10 a) Direct Finish P3. 5a/b 20m Nads Direct To the right of the slab and corner, head directly to the clean, obvious overhang. Place good cam protection in the overhang / roof, and make hard, strenuous moves right to gain the ramp. Traverse right along ramp to central crack, and finish delicately, straight up. A well protected challenge, crux high in the grade. (11) DICTATOR 75m E1 5b,4b The central and highest part of the crag is dominated by an impressive 45m. wall. This is bordered on the right by a deep grassy groove. Right of this there is an obvious thin diagonal crack trending leftwards up a steep slab(!). Start below a shallow corner at the bottom of the crack and about 9m. right of the deep grassy groove. The first pitch offers tremendous climbing. 1. 42m. 5b. Climb steeply up the corner to a ledge on the right at about 6m. Move left and continue easily up the crack to where it steepens at about 18m. Avoid the crack by following a line of holds on the left wall to a minute overlap. Traverse back right into the thin crack and up this (crux) to a second and larger overlap. Hand traverse down leftwards under the overlap for about 5m. and up to a small ledge. Climb diagonally rightwards to a confined grassy belay stance directly above the crack line. 2. 33m. 4b. Move left, firstly on grass and then rock to a small overlap. Over this and up a shallow groove for about 6m. At the top of the groove traverse right for about 5m. and pull up onto vegetation. Scramble up to an obvious short leftward-trending groove and up this to the top. Good nut belay (large hex.) about 9m. up the grassy ramp that forms the top of the buttress. The next three climbs are found close together in the centre of the crag left and right of a recessed zone of black rock. The first begins on the right side of a steep buttress left of the seepage zone. (12) BANBA 28M HVS 4c Climb a steep ramp to a grass ledge and belay. (13) DARK WATERS 56m VS Start just right of the seepage zone below a steep buttress and 2m. left of the start of Heuston Blues. 1. 28m, 4c. Up the narrowing ramp and crack to a grass ledge and a belay. 2. 28m, 4c. Up slabby rock to a grass ledge. Climb steepening rock to a bulge and finish. (The second pitch may be the top section of Heuston Blues) (14) HEUSTON BLUES 30m VS 4b About 273m. from the right end of the crag there is an area of black and often wet rock with a long 1m. wide overhang 9m's. up. This route climbs a zigzag crack line on the buttress right of the black rock. Start just right of a gully between the two buttresses at the bottom of a rightward-trending crack. Traverse rightwards along the crack to another crack slanting up leftwards. Climb this to a ledge at mid-height. Continue over a small bulge and hence up an easy crack to the top. (15) LAIRGREN 48m VS Start 75m. right of Dark Waters at a ramp - a few metres left of Blue Movie. 1. 23m, 4b. Climb the leftwards sloping ramp to a ledge and block belay. 2. 25m,4c. Climb up steeply and slightly left via discontinuous cracks to a ledge. Up again slightly left via a knobbly slab to steeper rock beneath a triangular niche. Climb up on smallish holds (crux) and finish up a gentle slab to belay. (16) BLUE MOVIE 36m S This climb follows an obvious blue-stained leftward-trending ramp about 30m. right of Heuston Blues. 1. 18m. Climb the ramp to a grassy ledge and belay. 2. 18m. Move left and follow a leftward-trending crack to a grassy ledge. Trend rightwards up a fine short wall of rough conglomerate. Poor protection. (17) PIONEER 20m E2 5c Takes a thin crack-line up the wall just right of the ramp of Blue Movie. Start directly below the crack. Scramble up to a grassy ledge at 3m. Trend right up the wall into the thin crack and up this (crux) to a large flake at mid-height. Continue awkwardly up the wider left-trending crack above to the top. Good climbing. (18) VOYAGER 20m E1 5b About 10m. right of Blue Movie there is a narrow left-trending ramp. Start under this. Climb the ramp for 5m. Step left onto small holds and climb steeply to larger holds. There is a poor flake runner out to the left. Continue up the wall, past a poor spike runner to regain the ramp which is followed to the top. Good climbing, though poorly protected. (19) AIFE 53m HVS A short but demanding and exciting first pitch. Start at a steep right-trending crack 50m. right of Lairgren. 1. 18m,5a/b. Climb crack (sustained but with good protection to a small ledge and then left for 5m. to a block belay. 2. 35m, 3c. Continue up the arête to easy ground. (20) IOLAR 40m VS Start 5m. right of Aife and 3m left of a dirty corner. 1. 28m, 3c. Up onto the arête to a large block and grassy ledge. Belay behind a large block at the base of the chimney. 2. 12m, 4c. Up the chimney and crack to an overhanging jammed block which is passed on the left with care. The following three climbs are located on the buttress near the right end of the crag. The buttress is characterized by two obvious wide cracks, one trending left and the other right. They meet some distance above the ground. Below the cracks there is a mossy area of rock: (21) COLUMBIA 21m VS 4c This route takes the left-hand crack mentioned above. Start at a broken crack just left of the mossy rock and about 2m. right of the gully forming the left-hand boundary of the buttress. Climb diagonally rightwards for about 5m. Ascend the thin jagged crack above to a niche in the wide crack at mid-height. Continue up the leftward-trending crack to the top. (22)WINGS 21m HVS 5b Start below a thin faint and red ramp about 9m. right of Columbia. Climb the ramp until further progress becomes difficult near the top. Traverse right across the wall to a crack and up this easily to the top. (Excellent sustained climbing.) (23) BEETLE This route takes a rightward-trending crack which starts just right of Wings. Climb the crack to the top. Scramble up to a block belay. (24) ARDAN 42m S 4a Start 3m. right of Beetle. 1. 20m. Up via niches to the arête and follow this to a ledge and belay. 2. 22m. Continue up easier ground to finish. (25) AINNLE 10m HVS 5a Unimpressive looking but probably worth it for the crux. Start right of Ardan at a small cave. Climb up to beneath the overhang, move left and gain the crack strenuously. Continue up more easily to the top. (26) BARACH 13m S 3c Start to the right of Ainnle. At a small buttress in a recess above the blockfield. Climb the arête on the left of the buttress passing the overhang (crux). (27) BRANWEN 13m V.Diff Start just right of Barach. Climb up the centre of the buttress past an overlap. (28) GUAIRE 47m HVS Start right of an obvious descent gully at a small, steep, smooth faced buttress. 1. 12m, 5a. Climb the centre of the buttress to the top treating the rock with care. Poor protection. 2. 35m, 3c. Climb the wall above on its left side directly to easy ground and belay. (29) CLIONA's WAVE 20m VS 4b Start near the western end of the crag just right of a grassy gully and directly above three obvious boulders. Climb the corner to dubious blocks and move right beneath an overhang. Gain height and move delicately left to the top of the overhang. Then move easily to the top. These routes lie on the cliffs above the south-west end of the lake at Doolough. The most striking buttress here is subtended by a Y-shaped gully. Ascend the rib on the left of the stem of the Y and then traverse onto the face of the buttress above the vegetated portion. The face above has two roughly parallel cracks and a smaller one on the extreme edge. Two routes were taken up the face. UNNAMED 1 45m V.Diff This route starts up the left-hand crack. 1. 15m.

Start at a steep groove - crackline near the right hand end of the buttress. Up the groove to steepening rock. Bridge up to gain a blocky hold on the right, 2m. from the top. Move delicately left to a wide crack and finish. (2) VOYAGER 42m VS 4c Start above and slightly to the right of Ailill at a large flake. Climb up onto the flake and follow the crack-line directly up the wall to steepening rock and the crux. Finish on good holds. Belay on a block some distance to the left and hard to find Left of the main face there is a small triangular buttress of superb smooth reddish rock. It is separated from the main face by a grassy gully. To the right of the buttress there is a large rocky gully which usually has a waterfall. The routes on this buttress are among the finest on the crag. (3) BRAGELA's WATCH 100m E1 An excellent climb with a real mountain atmosphere. Start to the east of the crag beneath a tall, steep, narrow buttress, just right of a major gully running up the hillside - about 20m. left of Nightrider. 1. 30m, 5b. Climb the left face of the buttress to a ledge (micro-wires) and then climb a steep ramp on the left of the buttress with increasing difficulty to a flake crack. Up more easily to a belay. 2. 20m, 3c. Move up rightwards to a grassy niche, and then left on a rock nose. Follow grass to belay at the base of a steep arête. 3. 30m, 5a. Climb up the arête passing a short vertical wall on the right. Continue up slightly right to grass ledge and back to a belay. 4. 20m, 3c. Move up right and then left via a ramp to easy ground and belay some distance to the right. (4) RED DAWN 25m E2 5c Another excellent and sustained climb with good protection. It takes the right hand of two cracks on the left side of the buttress. Approaching from the left make a difficult sequence of moves to gain the crack. Follow this to a difficult bulge to the top. Abseil off to the left. (5) LETTER TO BRESHNEV 30m E3/4 6a This excellent and serious route starts up a shallow groove near to the right side of the buttress. Bridge precariously up the sustained groove to a good peg at 10m. Make a difficult traverse right to large holds. Continue straight up past a poor peg to a crack leading left near the top. Follow this leftwards for 5m. to a short thin crack that leads to the top of the smooth face. Climb a slender pillar of rock above to a belay in a chimney on the left just under the top of the buttress. A superb sustained face climb. The following routes are all in the region of the main face, which is an impressive, relatively smooth sheet of rock about 45m. high, the highest buttress on the crag. It has a broad base but tapers towards the top. The right side of the face is a well defined arête with a deep grassy groove on its right. To the left of the face there is a detached buttress of smooth reddish rock. Left again there is a deep slimy gully with a waterfall. The best approach to the area is by following a vague sheep track contouring up over the NW side of Doo Lough to a broad scree filled gully extending down from the crag. Follow the left edge of the gully (about 45 minutes from the road). The starts of most routes are marked by small cairns. The climbs are generally good quality but care is required on some due to the brittle nature of the rock and poor protection. The crag is in a magnificent setting high above the lake with extensive views of mountains and Clew Bay. (6) EARTH WATCH 70m E1/2 Two contrasting pitches to the left of the main face. The first takes a short fragile looking wall sandwiched between the main face, a wide grassy gully on the left and a grassy terrace above. The second pitch takes a superb line up a prominent corner with overhangs on the upper left side of the main face. Start below the centre of the short wall at a shallow groove. 1. 30m. 5b. Make a difficult move up the groove to reach brittle flakes which lead to good holds near the top of the face (no. 6 rock sideways at 10m.). Pull precariously over grass and scramble up the terrace to a large blocky belay below the prominent corner (a serious pitch) 2. 40m. 5b. The corner is initially bulging. Climb this section on large holds. Continue up traversing under two overhangs to a third overhang. Climb over this using a wide crack to the top of the buttress. Scramble up heathery slopes to a spike belay. An excellent pitch on solid rock. It can be reached more easily and safely by starting up the first pitch of Nightrider, reducing the overall grade to E1. (7) NIGHTRIDER 70m E1/2 5b/c The crag is dominated by a large triangular face bounded on its right side by a deep grassy groove. This route takes a line up the left-hand side of the face. Start in the middle of the face. 1. 25m. 5b. Climb steeply up the wall to a left-trending diagonal crack. Follow this to a gully on the left side of the face. Continue up the left edge of the face until it is possible to move left into the gully. Block belay on the left at the top of the gully. 2. 45m. 5b/c. Traverse right for 7m. back onto the face (crux) to a crack. Climb the crack in a superb position to easy ground. Scramble up trending slightly right to a spike belay near the top. Escape off the cliff by first scrambling up leftwards and then up rightwards along a grassy ramp. (8) CHINA BEACH 60m E2 Takes zigzag cracks up the right side of the main face. A serious route due to sustained climbing on brittle rock and less than perfect protection. Start under the centre of the face just right of the start of Nightrider. 1. 20m. 5a. Climb steeply up to a narrow ledge. Continue up just left of a large sheet of smooth white rock to another narrow ledge below a thin crack. Make an uncomfortable belay on this ledge using a nut and a No. 1 Friend 3m. higher. 2. 40m. 5b. Climb the crack and move right to gain a long prominent left trending crack. Ascent to the top of the crack and move right to a right trending crack (No. 4 Friend) which is followed to the right arête of the face. Climb the arête which leads to scrambling and a poor spike belay. (9) SOLITAIRE 55m HS This route follows the prominent grassy groove that bounds the right side of the main face. Although heavily vegetated in the groove the climbing is entirely on solid rock. Start directly below the groove. Initially climb just left of the groove, then bridge across the vegetation until it gets slightly steeper at mid-height. Make a delicate move up the left slab of the groove to a ledge. Continue up to a steeper finish to gain the top right arête of the main face. Scramble up to the top of the buttress. (10) ON REFLECTION 115m VS 4b,4c,4b A good mountain route with good interest throughout. 1. 4b, 55m Start as for Solitaire, follow the major corner and arete feature as for Solitaire, to large block belay. A good pitch on solid rock with some bold climbing on the central section. (If in doubt trick your climbing buddy into leading this pitch) 2. 4c, 30m An Excellent varied pitch, well protected. Cross the grass ramp, move up and right to a steep wall and finger crack, (left of blocky section) Climb finger crack for 6 meters (crux) to ledge. Up on blocky ground trending left then right to obvious steep corner, superb bridging up corner to grass ledge and belay 3. 20m 4b, Drop down ramp for a few meters to next wall. Follow slab and corner for 10m, move left to steep wall, directly up this taking care with the rock to belay at massive boulder. (10 a) Direct Finish P3. 5a/b 20m Nads Direct To the right of the slab and corner, head directly to the clean, obvious overhang. Place good cam protection in the overhang / roof, and make hard, strenuous moves right to gain the ramp. Traverse right along ramp to central crack, and finish delicately, straight up. A well protected challenge, crux high in the grade. (11) DICTATOR 75m E1 5b,4b The central and highest part of the crag is dominated by an impressive 45m. wall. This is bordered on the right by a deep grassy groove. Right of this there is an obvious thin diagonal crack trending leftwards up a steep slab(!). Start below a shallow corner at the bottom of the crack and about 9m. right of the deep grassy groove. The first pitch offers tremendous climbing. 1. 42m. 5b. Climb steeply up the corner to a ledge on the right at about 6m. Move left and continue easily up the crack to where it steepens at about 18m. Avoid the crack by following a line of holds on the left wall to a minute overlap. Traverse back right into the thin crack and up this (crux) to a second and larger overlap. Hand traverse down leftwards under the overlap for about 5m. and up to a small ledge. Climb diagonally rightwards to a confined grassy belay stance directly above the crack line. 2. 33m. 4b. Move left, firstly on grass and then rock to a small overlap. Over this and up a shallow groove for about 6m. At the top of the groove traverse right for about 5m. and pull up onto vegetation. Scramble up to an obvious short leftward-trending groove and up this to the top. Good nut belay (large hex.) about 9m. up the grassy ramp that forms the top of the buttress. The next three climbs are found close together in the centre of the crag left and right of a recessed zone of black rock. The first begins on the right side of a steep buttress left of the seepage zone. (12) BANBA 28M HVS 4c Climb a steep ramp to a grass ledge and belay. (13) DARK WATERS 56m VS Start just right of the seepage zone below a steep buttress and 2m. left of the start of Heuston Blues. 1. 28m, 4c. Up the narrowing ramp and crack to a grass ledge and a belay. 2. 28m, 4c. Up slabby rock to a grass ledge. Climb steepening rock to a bulge and finish. (The second pitch may be the top section of Heuston Blues) (14) HEUSTON BLUES 30m VS 4b About 273m. from the right end of the crag there is an area of black and often wet rock with a long 1m. wide overhang 9m's. up. This route climbs a zigzag crack line on the buttress right of the black rock. Start just right of a gully between the two buttresses at the bottom of a rightward-trending crack. Traverse rightwards along the crack to another crack slanting up leftwards. Climb this to a ledge at mid-height. Continue over a small bulge and hence up an easy crack to the top. (15) LAIRGREN 48m VS Start 75m. right of Dark Waters at a ramp - a few metres left of Blue Movie. 1. 23m, 4b. Climb the leftwards sloping ramp to a ledge and block belay. 2. 25m,4c. Climb up steeply and slightly left via discontinuous cracks to a ledge. Up again slightly left via a knobbly slab to steeper rock beneath a triangular niche. Climb up on smallish holds (crux) and finish up a gentle slab to belay. (16) BLUE MOVIE 36m S This climb follows an obvious blue-stained leftward-trending ramp about 30m. right of Heuston Blues. 1. 18m. Climb the ramp to a grassy ledge and belay. 2. 18m. Move left and follow a leftward-trending crack to a grassy ledge. Trend rightwards up a fine short wall of rough conglomerate. Poor protection. (17) PIONEER 20m E2 5c Takes a thin crack-line up the wall just right of the ramp of Blue Movie. Start directly below the crack. Scramble up to a grassy ledge at 3m. Trend right up the wall into the thin crack and up this (crux) to a large flake at mid-height. Continue awkwardly up the wider left-trending crack above to the top. Good climbing. (18) VOYAGER 20m E1 5b About 10m. right of Blue Movie there is a narrow left-trending ramp. Start under this. Climb the ramp for 5m. Step left onto small holds and climb steeply to larger holds. There is a poor flake runner out to the left. Continue up the wall, past a poor spike runner to regain the ramp which is followed to the top. Good climbing, though poorly protected. (19) AIFE 53m HVS A short but demanding and exciting first pitch. Start at a steep right-trending crack 50m. right of Lairgren. 1. 18m,5a/b. Climb crack (sustained but with good protection to a small ledge and then left for 5m. to a block belay. 2. 35m, 3c. Continue up the arête to easy ground. (20) IOLAR 40m VS Start 5m. right of Aife and 3m left of a dirty corner. 1. 28m, 3c. Up onto the arête to a large block and grassy ledge. Belay behind a large block at the base of the chimney. 2. 12m, 4c. Up the chimney and crack to an overhanging jammed block which is passed on the left with care. The following three climbs are located on the buttress near the right end of the crag. The buttress is characterized by two obvious wide cracks, one trending left and the other right. They meet some distance above the ground. Below the cracks there is a mossy area of rock: (21) COLUMBIA 21m VS 4c This route takes the left-hand crack mentioned above. Start at a broken crack just left of the mossy rock and about 2m. right of the gully forming the left-hand boundary of the buttress. Climb diagonally rightwards for about 5m. Ascend the thin jagged crack above to a niche in the wide crack at mid-height. Continue up the leftward-trending crack to the top. (22)WINGS 21m HVS 5b Start below a thin faint and red ramp about 9m. right of Columbia. Climb the ramp until further progress becomes difficult near the top. Traverse right across the wall to a crack and up this easily to the top. (Excellent sustained climbing.) (23) BEETLE This route takes a rightward-trending crack which starts just right of Wings. Climb the crack to the top. Scramble up to a block belay. (24) ARDAN 42m S 4a Start 3m. right of Beetle. 1. 20m. Up via niches to the arête and follow this to a ledge and belay. 2. 22m. Continue up easier ground to finish. (25) AINNLE 10m HVS 5a Unimpressive looking but probably worth it for the crux. Start right of Ardan at a small cave. Climb up to beneath the overhang, move left and gain the crack strenuously. Continue up more easily to the top. (26) BARACH 13m S 3c Start to the right of Ainnle. At a small buttress in a recess above the blockfield. Climb the arête on the left of the buttress passing the overhang (crux). (27) BRANWEN 13m V.Diff Start just right of Barach. Climb up the centre of the buttress past an overlap. (28) GUAIRE 47m HVS Start right of an obvious descent gully at a small, steep, smooth faced buttress. 1. 12m, 5a. Climb the centre of the buttress to the top treating the rock with care. Poor protection. 2. 35m, 3c. Climb the wall above on its left side directly to easy ground and belay. (29) CLIONA's WAVE 20m VS 4b Start near the western end of the crag just right of a grassy gully and directly above three obvious boulders. Climb the corner to dubious blocks and move right beneath an overhang. Gain height and move delicately left to the top of the overhang. Then move easily to the top. These routes lie on the cliffs above the south-west end of the lake at Doolough. The most striking buttress here is subtended by a Y-shaped gully. Ascend the rib on the left of the stem of the Y and then traverse onto the face of the buttress above the vegetated portion. The face above has two roughly parallel cracks and a smaller one on the extreme edge. Two routes were taken up the face. UNNAMED 1 45m V.Diff This route starts up the left-hand crack. 1. 15m. Take the start of the left crack but pull out right up a sloping slab leading right back to the top of a pedestal in the middle of the face. 2. 15m. Take the right crack to ledge - caution with projecting blocks. Up groove to overhang. Traverse right to belay. 3. 15m. Take easy groove above to top. UNNAMED 2 55m MS The right-hand crack starts just to the right of a pedestal in the middle of the face.

            "description": "This climb is found on the most easterly of the smooth buttresses. Protection is not so good. Start at a steep groove - crackline near the right hand end of the buttress. Up the groove to steepening rock. Bridge up to gain a blocky hold on the right, 2m. from the top. Move delicately left to a wide crack and finish. (2) VOYAGER 42m VS 4c Start above and slightly to the right of Ailill at a large flake. Climb up onto the flake and follow the crack-line directly up the wall to steepening rock and the crux. Finish on good holds. Belay on a block some distance to the left and hard to find Left of the main face there is a small triangular buttress of superb smooth reddish rock. It is separated from the main face by a grassy gully. To the right of the buttress there is a large rocky gully which usually has a waterfall. The routes on this buttress are among the finest on the crag. (3) BRAGELA's WATCH 100m E1 An excellent climb with a real mountain atmosphere. Start to the east of the crag beneath a tall, steep, narrow buttress, just right of a major gully running up the hillside - about 20m. left of Nightrider. 1. 30m, 5b. Climb the left face of the buttress to a ledge (micro-wires) and then climb a steep ramp on the left of the buttress with increasing difficulty to a flake crack. Up more easily to a belay. 2. 20m, 3c. Move up rightwards to a grassy niche, and then left on a rock nose. Follow grass to belay at the base of a steep arête. 3. 30m, 5a. Climb up the arête passing a short vertical wall on the right. Continue up slightly right to grass ledge and back to a belay. 4. 20m, 3c. Move up right and then left via a ramp to easy ground and belay some distance to the right. (4) RED DAWN 25m E2 5c Another excellent and sustained climb with good protection. It takes the right hand of two cracks on the left side of the buttress. Approaching from the left make a difficult sequence of moves to gain the crack. Follow this to a difficult bulge to the top. Abseil off to the left. (5) LETTER TO BRESHNEV 30m E3/4 6a This excellent and serious route starts up a shallow groove near to the right side of the buttress. Bridge precariously up the sustained groove to a good peg at 10m. Make a difficult traverse right to large holds. Continue straight up past a poor peg to a crack leading left near the top. Follow this leftwards for 5m. to a short thin crack that leads to the top of the smooth face. Climb a slender pillar of rock above to a belay in a chimney on the left just under the top of the buttress. A superb sustained face climb. The following routes are all in the region of the main face, which is an impressive, relatively smooth sheet of rock about 45m. high, the highest buttress on the crag. It has a broad base but tapers towards the top. The right side of the face is a well defined arête with a deep grassy groove on its right. To the left of the face there is a detached buttress of smooth reddish rock. Left again there is a deep slimy gully with a waterfall. The best approach to the area is by following a vague sheep track contouring up over the NW side of Doo Lough to a broad scree filled gully extending down from the crag. Follow the left edge of the gully (about 45 minutes from the road). The starts of most routes are marked by small cairns. The climbs are generally good quality but care is required on some due to the brittle nature of the rock and poor protection. The crag is in a magnificent setting high above the lake with extensive views of mountains and Clew Bay. (6) EARTH WATCH 70m E1/2 Two contrasting pitches to the left of the main face. The first takes a short fragile looking wall sandwiched between the main face, a wide grassy gully on the left and a grassy terrace above. The second pitch takes a superb line up a prominent corner with overhangs on the upper left side of the main face. Start below the centre of the short wall at a shallow groove. 1. 30m. 5b. Make a difficult move up the groove to reach brittle flakes which lead to good holds near the top of the face (no. 6 rock sideways at 10m.). Pull precariously over grass and scramble up the terrace to a large blocky belay below the prominent corner (a serious pitch) 2. 40m. 5b. The corner is initially bulging. Climb this section on large holds. Continue up traversing under two overhangs to a third overhang. Climb over this using a wide crack to the top of the buttress. Scramble up heathery slopes to a spike belay. An excellent pitch on solid rock. It can be reached more easily and safely by starting up the first pitch of Nightrider, reducing the overall grade to E1. (7) NIGHTRIDER 70m E1/2 5b/c The crag is dominated by a large triangular face bounded on its right side by a deep grassy groove. This route takes a line up the left-hand side of the face. Start in the middle of the face. 1. 25m. 5b. Climb steeply up the wall to a left-trending diagonal crack. Follow this to a gully on the left side of the face. Continue up the left edge of the face until it is possible to move left into the gully. Block belay on the left at the top of the gully. 2. 45m. 5b/c. Traverse right for 7m. back onto the face (crux) to a crack. Climb the crack in a superb position to easy ground. Scramble up trending slightly right to a spike belay near the top. Escape off the cliff by first scrambling up leftwards and then up rightwards along a grassy ramp. (8) CHINA BEACH 60m E2 Takes zigzag cracks up the right side of the main face. A serious route due to sustained climbing on brittle rock and less than perfect protection. Start under the centre of the face just right of the start of Nightrider. 1. 20m. 5a. Climb steeply up to a narrow ledge. Continue up just left of a large sheet of smooth white rock to another narrow ledge below a thin crack. Make an uncomfortable belay on this ledge using a nut and a No. 1 Friend 3m. higher. 2. 40m. 5b. Climb the crack and move right to gain a long prominent left trending crack. Ascent to the top of the crack and move right to a right trending crack (No. 4 Friend) which is followed to the right arête of the face. Climb the arête which leads to scrambling and a poor spike belay. (9) SOLITAIRE 55m HS This route follows the prominent grassy groove that bounds the right side of the main face. Although heavily vegetated in the groove the climbing is entirely on solid rock. Start directly below the groove. Initially climb just left of the groove, then bridge across the vegetation until it gets slightly steeper at mid-height. Make a delicate move up the left slab of the groove to a ledge. Continue up to a steeper finish to gain the top right arête of the main face. Scramble up to the top of the buttress. (10) ON REFLECTION 115m VS 4b,4c,4b A good mountain route with good interest throughout. 1. 4b, 55m Start as for Solitaire, follow the major corner and arete feature as for Solitaire, to large block belay. A good pitch on solid rock with some bold climbing on the central section. (If in doubt trick your climbing buddy into leading this pitch) 2. 4c, 30m An Excellent varied pitch, well protected. Cross the grass ramp, move up and right to a steep wall and finger crack, (left of blocky section) Climb finger crack for 6 meters (crux) to ledge. Up on blocky ground trending left then right to obvious steep corner, superb bridging up corner to grass ledge and belay 3. 20m 4b, Drop down ramp for a few meters to next wall. Follow slab and corner for 10m, move left to steep wall, directly up this taking care with the rock to belay at massive boulder. (10 a) Direct Finish P3. 5a/b 20m Nads Direct To the right of the slab and corner, head directly to the clean, obvious overhang. Place good cam protection in the overhang / roof, and make hard, strenuous moves right to gain the ramp. Traverse right along ramp to central crack, and finish delicately, straight up. A well protected challenge, crux high in the grade. (11) DICTATOR 75m E1 5b,4b The central and highest part of the crag is dominated by an impressive 45m. wall. This is bordered on the right by a deep grassy groove. Right of this there is an obvious thin diagonal crack trending leftwards up a steep slab(!). Start below a shallow corner at the bottom of the crack and about 9m. right of the deep grassy groove. The first pitch offers tremendous climbing. 1. 42m. 5b. Climb steeply up the corner to a ledge on the right at about 6m. Move left and continue easily up the crack to where it steepens at about 18m. Avoid the crack by following a line of holds on the left wall to a minute overlap. Traverse back right into the thin crack and up this (crux) to a second and larger overlap. Hand traverse down leftwards under the overlap for about 5m. and up to a small ledge. Climb diagonally rightwards to a confined grassy belay stance directly above the crack line. 2. 33m. 4b. Move left, firstly on grass and then rock to a small overlap. Over this and up a shallow groove for about 6m. At the top of the groove traverse right for about 5m. and pull up onto vegetation. Scramble up to an obvious short leftward-trending groove and up this to the top. Good nut belay (large hex.) about 9m. up the grassy ramp that forms the top of the buttress. The next three climbs are found close together in the centre of the crag left and right of a recessed zone of black rock. The first begins on the right side of a steep buttress left of the seepage zone. (12) BANBA 28M HVS 4c Climb a steep ramp to a grass ledge and belay. (13) DARK WATERS 56m VS Start just right of the seepage zone below a steep buttress and 2m. left of the start of Heuston Blues. 1. 28m, 4c. Up the narrowing ramp and crack to a grass ledge and a belay. 2. 28m, 4c. Up slabby rock to a grass ledge. Climb steepening rock to a bulge and finish. (The second pitch may be the top section of Heuston Blues) (14) HEUSTON BLUES 30m VS 4b About 273m. from the right end of the crag there is an area of black and often wet rock with a long 1m. wide overhang 9m's. up. This route climbs a zigzag crack line on the buttress right of the black rock. Start just right of a gully between the two buttresses at the bottom of a rightward-trending crack. Traverse rightwards along the crack to another crack slanting up leftwards. Climb this to a ledge at mid-height. Continue over a small bulge and hence up an easy crack to the top. (15) LAIRGREN 48m VS Start 75m. right of Dark Waters at a ramp - a few metres left of Blue Movie. 1. 23m, 4b. Climb the leftwards sloping ramp to a ledge and block belay. 2. 25m,4c. Climb up steeply and slightly left via discontinuous cracks to a ledge. Up again slightly left via a knobbly slab to steeper rock beneath a triangular niche. Climb up on smallish holds (crux) and finish up a gentle slab to belay. (16) BLUE MOVIE 36m S This climb follows an obvious blue-stained leftward-trending ramp about 30m. right of Heuston Blues. 1. 18m. Climb the ramp to a grassy ledge and belay. 2. 18m. Move left and follow a leftward-trending crack to a grassy ledge. Trend rightwards up a fine short wall of rough conglomerate. Poor protection.

Follow the left edge of the gully (about 45 minutes from the road). The starts of most routes are marked by small cairns. The climbs are generally good quality but care is required on some due to the brittle nature of the rock and poor protection. The crag is in a magnificent setting high above the lake with extensive views of mountains and Clew Bay. (6) EARTH WATCH 70m E1/2 Two contrasting pitches to the left of the main face. The first takes a short fragile looking wall sandwiched between the main face, a wide grassy gully on the left and a grassy terrace above. The second pitch takes a superb line up a prominent corner with overhangs on the upper left side of the main face. Start below the centre of the short wall at a shallow groove. 1. 30m. 5b. Make a difficult move up the groove to reach brittle flakes which lead to good holds near the top of the face (no. 6 rock sideways at 10m.). Pull precariously over grass and scramble up the terrace to a large blocky belay below the prominent corner (a serious pitch) 2. 40m. 5b. The corner is initially bulging. Climb this section on large holds. Continue up traversing under two overhangs to a third overhang. Climb over this using a wide crack to the top of the buttress. Scramble up heathery slopes to a spike belay. An excellent pitch on solid rock. It can be reached more easily and safely by starting up the first pitch of Nightrider, reducing the overall grade to E1. (7) NIGHTRIDER 70m E1/2 5b/c The crag is dominated by a large triangular face bounded on its right side by a deep grassy groove. This route takes a line up the left-hand side of the face. Start in the middle of the face. 1. 25m. 5b. Climb steeply up the wall to a left-trending diagonal crack. Follow this to a gully on the left side of the face. Continue up the left edge of the face until it is possible to move left into the gully. Block belay on the left at the top of the gully. 2. 45m. 5b/c. Traverse right for 7m. back onto the face (crux) to a crack. Climb the crack in a superb position to easy ground. Scramble up trending slightly right to a spike belay near the top. Escape off the cliff by first scrambling up leftwards and then up rightwards along a grassy ramp. (8) CHINA BEACH 60m E2 Takes zigzag cracks up the right side of the main face. A serious route due to sustained climbing on brittle rock and less than perfect protection. Start under the centre of the face just right of the start of Nightrider. 1. 20m. 5a. Climb steeply up to a narrow ledge. Continue up just left of a large sheet of smooth white rock to another narrow ledge below a thin crack. Make an uncomfortable belay on this ledge using a nut and a No. 1 Friend 3m. higher. 2. 40m. 5b. Climb the crack and move right to gain a long prominent left trending crack. Ascent to the top of the crack and move right to a right trending crack (No. 4 Friend) which is followed to the right arête of the face. Climb the arête which leads to scrambling and a poor spike belay. (9) SOLITAIRE 55m HS This route follows the prominent grassy groove that bounds the right side of the main face. Although heavily vegetated in the groove the climbing is entirely on solid rock. Start directly below the groove. Initially climb just left of the groove, then bridge across the vegetation until it gets slightly steeper at mid-height. Make a delicate move up the left slab of the groove to a ledge. Continue up to a steeper finish to gain the top right arête of the main face. Scramble up to the top of the buttress. (10) ON REFLECTION 115m VS 4b,4c,4b A good mountain route with good interest throughout. 1. 4b, 55m Start as for Solitaire, follow the major corner and arete feature as for Solitaire, to large block belay. A good pitch on solid rock with some bold climbing on the central section. (If in doubt trick your climbing buddy into leading this pitch) 2. 4c, 30m An Excellent varied pitch, well protected. Cross the grass ramp, move up and right to a steep wall and finger crack, (left of blocky section) Climb finger crack for 6 meters (crux) to ledge. Up on blocky ground trending left then right to obvious steep corner, superb bridging up corner to grass ledge and belay 3. 20m 4b, Drop down ramp for a few meters to next wall. Follow slab and corner for 10m, move left to steep wall, directly up this taking care with the rock to belay at massive boulder. (10 a) Direct Finish P3. 5a/b 20m Nads Direct To the right of the slab and corner, head directly to the clean, obvious overhang. Place good cam protection in the overhang / roof, and make hard, strenuous moves right to gain the ramp. Traverse right along ramp to central crack, and finish delicately, straight up. A well protected challenge, crux high in the grade. (11) DICTATOR 75m E1 5b,4b The central and highest part of the crag is dominated by an impressive 45m. wall. This is bordered on the right by a deep grassy groove. Right of this there is an obvious thin diagonal crack trending leftwards up a steep slab(!). Start below a shallow corner at the bottom of the crack and about 9m. right of the deep grassy groove. The first pitch offers tremendous climbing. 1. 42m. 5b. Climb steeply up the corner to a ledge on the right at about 6m. Move left and continue easily up the crack to where it steepens at about 18m. Avoid the crack by following a line of holds on the left wall to a minute overlap. Traverse back right into the thin crack and up this (crux) to a second and larger overlap. Hand traverse down leftwards under the overlap for about 5m. and up to a small ledge. Climb diagonally rightwards to a confined grassy belay stance directly above the crack line. 2. 33m. 4b. Move left, firstly on grass and then rock to a small overlap. Over this and up a shallow groove for about 6m. At the top of the groove traverse right for about 5m. and pull up onto vegetation. Scramble up to an obvious short leftward-trending groove and up this to the top. Good nut belay (large hex.) about 9m. up the grassy ramp that forms the top of the buttress. The next three climbs are found close together in the centre of the crag left and right of a recessed zone of black rock. The first begins on the right side of a steep buttress left of the seepage zone. (12) BANBA 28M HVS 4c Climb a steep ramp to a grass ledge and belay. (13) DARK WATERS 56m VS Start just right of the seepage zone below a steep buttress and 2m. left of the start of Heuston Blues. 1. 28m, 4c. Up the narrowing ramp and crack to a grass ledge and a belay. 2. 28m, 4c. Up slabby rock to a grass ledge. Climb steepening rock to a bulge and finish. (The second pitch may be the top section of Heuston Blues) (14) HEUSTON BLUES 30m VS 4b About 273m. from the right end of the crag there is an area of black and often wet rock with a long 1m. wide overhang 9m's. up. This route climbs a zigzag crack line on the buttress right of the black rock. Start just right of a gully between the two buttresses at the bottom of a rightward-trending crack. Traverse rightwards along the crack to another crack slanting up leftwards. Climb this to a ledge at mid-height. Continue over a small bulge and hence up an easy crack to the top. (15) LAIRGREN 48m VS Start 75m. right of Dark Waters at a ramp - a few metres left of Blue Movie. 1. 23m, 4b. Climb the leftwards sloping ramp to a ledge and block belay. 2. 25m,4c. Climb up steeply and slightly left via discontinuous cracks to a ledge. Up again slightly left via a knobbly slab to steeper rock beneath a triangular niche. Climb up on smallish holds (crux) and finish up a gentle slab to belay. (16) BLUE MOVIE 36m S This climb follows an obvious blue-stained leftward-trending ramp about 30m. right of Heuston Blues. 1. 18m. Climb the ramp to a grassy ledge and belay. 2. 18m. Move left and follow a leftward-trending crack to a grassy ledge. Trend rightwards up a fine short wall of rough conglomerate. Poor protection. (17) PIONEER 20m E2 5c Takes a thin crack-line up the wall just right of the ramp of Blue Movie. Start directly below the crack. Scramble up to a grassy ledge at 3m. Trend right up the wall into the thin crack and up this (crux) to a large flake at mid-height. Continue awkwardly up the wider left-trending crack above to the top. Good climbing. (18) VOYAGER 20m E1 5b About 10m. right of Blue Movie there is a narrow left-trending ramp. Start under this. Climb the ramp for 5m. Step left onto small holds and climb steeply to larger holds. There is a poor flake runner out to the left. Continue up the wall, past a poor spike runner to regain the ramp which is followed to the top. Good climbing, though poorly protected. (19) AIFE 53m HVS A short but demanding and exciting first pitch. Start at a steep right-trending crack 50m. right of Lairgren. 1. 18m,5a/b. Climb crack (sustained but with good protection to a small ledge and then left for 5m. to a block belay. 2. 35m, 3c. Continue up the arête to easy ground. (20) IOLAR 40m VS Start 5m. right of Aife and 3m left of a dirty corner. 1. 28m, 3c. Up onto the arête to a large block and grassy ledge. Belay behind a large block at the base of the chimney. 2. 12m, 4c. Up the chimney and crack to an overhanging jammed block which is passed on the left with care. The following three climbs are located on the buttress near the right end of the crag. The buttress is characterized by two obvious wide cracks, one trending left and the other right. They meet some distance above the ground. Below the cracks there is a mossy area of rock: (21) COLUMBIA 21m VS 4c This route takes the left-hand crack mentioned above. Start at a broken crack just left of the mossy rock and about 2m. right of the gully forming the left-hand boundary of the buttress. Climb diagonally rightwards for about 5m. Ascend the thin jagged crack above to a niche in the wide crack at mid-height. Continue up the leftward-trending crack to the top. (22)WINGS 21m HVS 5b Start below a thin faint and red ramp about 9m. right of Columbia. Climb the ramp until further progress becomes difficult near the top. Traverse right across the wall to a crack and up this easily to the top. (Excellent sustained climbing.) (23) BEETLE This route takes a rightward-trending crack which starts just right of Wings. Climb the crack to the top. Scramble up to a block belay. (24) ARDAN 42m S 4a Start 3m. right of Beetle. 1. 20m. Up via niches to the arête and follow this to a ledge and belay. 2. 22m. Continue up easier ground to finish. (25) AINNLE 10m HVS 5a Unimpressive looking but probably worth it for the crux. Start right of Ardan at a small cave. Climb up to beneath the overhang, move left and gain the crack strenuously. Continue up more easily to the top. (26) BARACH 13m S 3c Start to the right of Ainnle. At a small buttress in a recess above the blockfield. Climb the arête on the left of the buttress passing the overhang (crux). (27) BRANWEN 13m V.Diff Start just right of Barach.

Climb the corner to dubious blocks and move right beneath an overhang. Gain height and move delicately left to the top of the overhang. Then move easily to the top. These routes lie on the cliffs above the south-west end of the lake at Doolough. The most striking buttress here is subtended by a Y-shaped gully. Ascend the rib on the left of the stem of the Y and then traverse onto the face of the buttress above the vegetated portion. The face above has two roughly parallel cracks and a smaller one on the extreme edge. Two routes were taken up the face. UNNAMED 1 45m V.Diff This route starts up the left-hand crack. 1. 15m.

Follow this leftwards for 5m. to a short thin crack that leads to the top of the smooth face. Climb a slender pillar of rock above to a belay in a chimney on the left just under the top of the buttress. A superb sustained face climb. The following routes are all in the region of the main face, which is an impressive, relatively smooth sheet of rock about 45m. high, the highest buttress on the crag. It has a broad base but tapers towards the top. The right side of the face is a well defined arête with a deep grassy groove on its right. To the left of the face there is a detached buttress of smooth reddish rock. Left again there is a deep slimy gully with a waterfall. The best approach to the area is by following a vague sheep track contouring up over the NW side of Doo Lough to a broad scree filled gully extending down from the crag. Follow the left edge of the gully (about 45 minutes from the road). The starts of most routes are marked by small cairns.

Bridge precariously up the sustained groove to a good peg at 10m. Make a difficult traverse right to large holds. Continue straight up past a poor peg to a crack leading left near the top. Follow this leftwards for 5m. to a short thin crack that leads to the top of the smooth face. Climb a slender pillar of rock above to a belay in a chimney on the left just under the top of the buttress. A superb sustained face climb. The following routes are all in the region of the main face, which is an impressive, relatively smooth sheet of rock about 45m. high, the highest buttress on the crag. It has a broad base but tapers towards the top. The right side of the face is a well defined arête with a deep grassy groove on its right. To the left of the face there is a detached buttress of smooth reddish rock. Left again there is a deep slimy gully with a waterfall. The best approach to the area is by following a vague sheep track contouring up over the NW side of Doo Lough to a broad scree filled gully extending down from the crag. Follow the left edge of the gully (about 45 minutes from the road). The starts of most routes are marked by small cairns. The climbs are generally good quality but care is required on some due to the brittle nature of the rock and poor protection. The crag is in a magnificent setting high above the lake with extensive views of mountains and Clew Bay. (6) EARTH WATCH 70m E1/2 Two contrasting pitches to the left of the main face. The first takes a short fragile looking wall sandwiched between the main face, a wide grassy gully on the left and a grassy terrace above. The second pitch takes a superb line up a prominent corner with overhangs on the upper left side of the main face. Start below the centre of the short wall at a shallow groove. 1. 30m. 5b. Make a difficult move up the groove to reach brittle flakes which lead to good holds near the top of the face (no. 6 rock sideways at 10m.). Pull precariously over grass and scramble up the terrace to a large blocky belay below the prominent corner (a serious pitch) 2. 40m. 5b. The corner is initially bulging. Climb this section on large holds. Continue up traversing under two overhangs to a third overhang. Climb over this using a wide crack to the top of the buttress. Scramble up heathery slopes to a spike belay. An excellent pitch on solid rock. It can be reached more easily and safely by starting up the first pitch of Nightrider, reducing the overall grade to E1. (7) NIGHTRIDER 70m E1/2 5b/c The crag is dominated by a large triangular face bounded on its right side by a deep grassy groove. This route takes a line up the left-hand side of the face. Start in the middle of the face. 1. 25m. 5b. Climb steeply up the wall to a left-trending diagonal crack. Follow this to a gully on the left side of the face. Continue up the left edge of the face until it is possible to move left into the gully. Block belay on the left at the top of the gully. 2. 45m. 5b/c. Traverse right for 7m. back onto the face (crux) to a crack. Climb the crack in a superb position to easy ground. Scramble up trending slightly right to a spike belay near the top. Escape off the cliff by first scrambling up leftwards and then up rightwards along a grassy ramp. (8) CHINA BEACH 60m E2 Takes zigzag cracks up the right side of the main face. A serious route due to sustained climbing on brittle rock and less than perfect protection. Start under the centre of the face just right of the start of Nightrider. 1. 20m. 5a. Climb steeply up to a narrow ledge. Continue up just left of a large sheet of smooth white rock to another narrow ledge below a thin crack. Make an uncomfortable belay on this ledge using a nut and a No. 1 Friend 3m. higher. 2. 40m. 5b. Climb the crack and move right to gain a long prominent left trending crack. Ascent to the top of the crack and move right to a right trending crack (No. 4 Friend) which is followed to the right arête of the face. Climb the arête which leads to scrambling and a poor spike belay. (9) SOLITAIRE 55m HS This route follows the prominent grassy groove that bounds the right side of the main face. Although heavily vegetated in the groove the climbing is entirely on solid rock. Start directly below the groove. Initially climb just left of the groove, then bridge across the vegetation until it gets slightly steeper at mid-height. Make a delicate move up the left slab of the groove to a ledge. Continue up to a steeper finish to gain the top right arête of the main face. Scramble up to the top of the buttress. (10) ON REFLECTION 115m VS 4b,4c,4b A good mountain route with good interest throughout. 1. 4b, 55m Start as for Solitaire, follow the major corner and arete feature as for Solitaire, to large block belay. A good pitch on solid rock with some bold climbing on the central section. (If in doubt trick your climbing buddy into leading this pitch) 2. 4c, 30m An Excellent varied pitch, well protected. Cross the grass ramp, move up and right to a steep wall and finger crack, (left of blocky section) Climb finger crack for 6 meters (crux) to ledge. Up on blocky ground trending left then right to obvious steep corner, superb bridging up corner to grass ledge and belay 3. 20m 4b, Drop down ramp for a few meters to next wall. Follow slab and corner for 10m, move left to steep wall, directly up this taking care with the rock to belay at massive boulder. (10 a) Direct Finish P3. 5a/b 20m Nads Direct To the right of the slab and corner, head directly to the clean, obvious overhang. Place good cam protection in the overhang / roof, and make hard, strenuous moves right to gain the ramp. Traverse right along ramp to central crack, and finish delicately, straight up. A well protected challenge, crux high in the grade. (11) DICTATOR 75m E1 5b,4b The central and highest part of the crag is dominated by an impressive 45m. wall. This is bordered on the right by a deep grassy groove. Right of this there is an obvious thin diagonal crack trending leftwards up a steep slab(!). Start below a shallow corner at the bottom of the crack and about 9m. right of the deep grassy groove. The first pitch offers tremendous climbing. 1. 42m. 5b. Climb steeply up the corner to a ledge on the right at about 6m. Move left and continue easily up the crack to where it steepens at about 18m. Avoid the crack by following a line of holds on the left wall to a minute overlap. Traverse back right into the thin crack and up this (crux) to a second and larger overlap. Hand traverse down leftwards under the overlap for about 5m. and up to a small ledge. Climb diagonally rightwards to a confined grassy belay stance directly above the crack line. 2. 33m. 4b. Move left, firstly on grass and then rock to a small overlap. Over this and up a shallow groove for about 6m. At the top of the groove traverse right for about 5m. and pull up onto vegetation. Scramble up to an obvious short leftward-trending groove and up this to the top. Good nut belay (large hex.) about 9m. up the grassy ramp that forms the top of the buttress. The next three climbs are found close together in the centre of the crag left and right of a recessed zone of black rock. The first begins on the right side of a steep buttress left of the seepage zone. (12) BANBA 28M HVS 4c Climb a steep ramp to a grass ledge and belay. (13) DARK WATERS 56m VS Start just right of the seepage zone below a steep buttress and 2m. left of the start of Heuston Blues. 1. 28m, 4c. Up the narrowing ramp and crack to a grass ledge and a belay. 2. 28m, 4c. Up slabby rock to a grass ledge. Climb steepening rock to a bulge and finish. (The second pitch may be the top section of Heuston Blues) (14) HEUSTON BLUES 30m VS 4b About 273m. from the right end of the crag there is an area of black and often wet rock with a long 1m. wide overhang 9m's. up. This route climbs a zigzag crack line on the buttress right of the black rock. Start just right of a gully between the two buttresses at the bottom of a rightward-trending crack. Traverse rightwards along the crack to another crack slanting up leftwards. Climb this to a ledge at mid-height. Continue over a small bulge and hence up an easy crack to the top. (15) LAIRGREN 48m VS Start 75m. right of Dark Waters at a ramp - a few metres left of Blue Movie. 1. 23m, 4b. Climb the leftwards sloping ramp to a ledge and block belay. 2. 25m,4c. Climb up steeply and slightly left via discontinuous cracks to a ledge. Up again slightly left via a knobbly slab to steeper rock beneath a triangular niche. Climb up on smallish holds (crux) and finish up a gentle slab to belay. (16) BLUE MOVIE 36m S This climb follows an obvious blue-stained leftward-trending ramp about 30m. right of Heuston Blues. 1. 18m. Climb the ramp to a grassy ledge and belay. 2. 18m. Move left and follow a leftward-trending crack to a grassy ledge. Trend rightwards up a fine short wall of rough conglomerate. Poor protection. (17) PIONEER 20m E2 5c Takes a thin crack-line up the wall just right of the ramp of Blue Movie. Start directly below the crack. Scramble up to a grassy ledge at 3m. Trend right up the wall into the thin crack and up this (crux) to a large flake at mid-height. Continue awkwardly up the wider left-trending crack above to the top. Good climbing. (18) VOYAGER 20m E1 5b About 10m. right of Blue Movie there is a narrow left-trending ramp. Start under this. Climb the ramp for 5m. Step left onto small holds and climb steeply to larger holds. There is a poor flake runner out to the left. Continue up the wall, past a poor spike runner to regain the ramp which is followed to the top. Good climbing, though poorly protected. (19) AIFE 53m HVS A short but demanding and exciting first pitch. Start at a steep right-trending crack 50m. right of Lairgren. 1. 18m,5a/b. Climb crack (sustained but with good protection to a small ledge and then left for 5m. to a block belay. 2. 35m, 3c. Continue up the arête to easy ground. (20) IOLAR 40m VS Start 5m. right of Aife and 3m left of a dirty corner. 1. 28m, 3c. Up onto the arête to a large block and grassy ledge. Belay behind a large block at the base of the chimney. 2. 12m, 4c. Up the chimney and crack to an overhanging jammed block which is passed on the left with care. The following three climbs are located on the buttress near the right end of the crag. The buttress is characterized by two obvious wide cracks, one trending left and the other right. They meet some distance above the ground. Below the cracks there is a mossy area of rock: (21) COLUMBIA 21m VS 4c This route takes the left-hand crack mentioned above. Start at a broken crack just left of the mossy rock and about 2m. right of the gully forming the left-hand boundary of the buttress. Climb diagonally rightwards for about 5m. Ascend the thin jagged crack above to a niche in the wide crack at mid-height. Continue up the leftward-trending crack to the top. (22)WINGS 21m HVS 5b Start below a thin faint and red ramp about 9m. right of Columbia. Climb the ramp until further progress becomes difficult near the top. Traverse right across the wall to a crack and up this easily to the top. (Excellent sustained climbing.) (23) BEETLE This route takes a rightward-trending crack which starts just right of Wings. Climb the crack to the top. Scramble up to a block belay. (24) ARDAN 42m S 4a Start 3m. right of Beetle. 1. 20m. Up via niches to the arête and follow this to a ledge and belay. 2. 22m. Continue up easier ground to finish. (25) AINNLE 10m HVS 5a Unimpressive looking but probably worth it for the crux. Start right of Ardan at a small cave. Climb up to beneath the overhang, move left and gain the crack strenuously. Continue up more easily to the top. (26) BARACH 13m S 3c Start to the right of Ainnle.

They meet some distance above the ground. Below the cracks there is a mossy area of rock: (21) COLUMBIA 21m VS 4c This route takes the left-hand crack mentioned above. Start at a broken crack just left of the mossy rock and about 2m. right of the gully forming the left-hand boundary of the buttress. Climb diagonally rightwards for about 5m. Ascend the thin jagged crack above to a niche in the wide crack at mid-height. Continue up the leftward-trending crack to the top. (22)WINGS 21m HVS 5b Start below a thin faint and red ramp about 9m. right of Columbia. Climb the ramp until further progress becomes difficult near the top. Traverse right across the wall to a crack and up this easily to the top. (Excellent sustained climbing.) (23) BEETLE This route takes a rightward-trending crack which starts just right of Wings. Climb the crack to the top. Scramble up to a block belay. (24) ARDAN 42m S 4a Start 3m. right of Beetle. 1. 20m. Up via niches to the arête and follow this to a ledge and belay. 2. 22m.

Climb the corner to dubious blocks and move right beneath an overhang. Gain height and move delicately left to the top of the overhang. Then move easily to the top. These routes lie on the cliffs above the south-west end of the lake at Doolough. The most striking buttress here is subtended by a Y-shaped gully. Ascend the rib on the left of the stem of the Y and then traverse onto the face of the buttress above the vegetated portion. The face above has two roughly parallel cracks and a smaller one on the extreme edge. Two routes were taken up the face. UNNAMED 1 45m V.Diff This route starts up the left-hand crack. 1. 15m.

Climb up on smallish holds (crux) and finish up a gentle slab to belay. (16) BLUE MOVIE 36m S This climb follows an obvious blue-stained leftward-trending ramp about 30m. right of Heuston Blues. 1. 18m. Climb the ramp to a grassy ledge and belay. 2. 18m. Move left and follow a leftward-trending crack to a grassy ledge. Trend rightwards up a fine short wall of rough conglomerate. Poor protection. (17) PIONEER 20m E2 5c Takes a thin crack-line up the wall just right of the ramp of Blue Movie. Start directly below the crack. Scramble up to a grassy ledge at 3m. Trend right up the wall into the thin crack and up this (crux) to a large flake at mid-height. Continue awkwardly up the wider left-trending crack above to the top. Good climbing. (18) VOYAGER 20m E1 5b About 10m. right of Blue Movie there is a narrow left-trending ramp. Start under this. Climb the ramp for 5m. Step left onto small holds and climb steeply to larger holds. There is a poor flake runner out to the left. Continue up the wall, past a poor spike runner to regain the ramp which is followed to the top. Good climbing, though poorly protected.

The following three climbs are located on the buttress near the right end of the crag. The buttress is characterized by two obvious wide cracks, one trending left and the other right. They meet some distance above the ground. Below the cracks there is a mossy area of rock: (21) COLUMBIA 21m VS 4c This route takes the left-hand crack mentioned above. Start at a broken crack just left of the mossy rock and about 2m. right of the gully forming the left-hand boundary of the buttress. Climb diagonally rightwards for about 5m. Ascend the thin jagged crack above to a niche in the wide crack at mid-height. Continue up the leftward-trending crack to the top. (22)WINGS 21m HVS 5b Start below a thin faint and red ramp about 9m. right of Columbia. Climb the ramp until further progress becomes difficult near the top. Traverse right across the wall to a crack and up this easily to the top. (Excellent sustained climbing.) (23) BEETLE This route takes a rightward-trending crack which starts just right of Wings.

Climb the corner to dubious blocks and move right beneath an overhang. Gain height and move delicately left to the top of the overhang. Then move easily to the top. These routes lie on the cliffs above the south-west end of the lake at Doolough. The most striking buttress here is subtended by a Y-shaped gully. Ascend the rib on the left of the stem of the Y and then traverse onto the face of the buttress above the vegetated portion.

Ab down to the overhanging corner, to the right of the Prow, and swing 7m L (gulp) to belay on a ledge at the base of a ahort corner, directly under the Prow. If the seas are rough you'd want to belay at the top of this corner. Climb the corner and arete above to a small brown ledge on the R side of the Prow at 10m. Move up under the bulge and step R and up, past the crux and a peg, to a ledge at a red quartz patch above the bulge. Zigzag R then L past the first overhang above you and climb the second directly using a short deep crack on the wall above. Continue on up to an arete on the L then back R to finish up a short corner. Titanic E2 5c 30m This immaculate pitch starts from the belay below the shallow quartz groove 4m R of the overhanging corner.

Keeping the obvious slab on the L, move up to the first corner which leads to the crux at a small overhang. Once you've gained the crack above finish up nonchantly to the top on loose rock. Drop the Dead Donkey E2 5b 35m Abseil down the central corner that splits the Nort and South Flanks and belay on a good ledge 10m above the sea. The route climbs the crack just L of the corner, which is nice and strenuous at first but gets quite serious in its middle section. Move up the basalt dike to where the crack almost closes, and pass this section using small holds on the L (crux). Follow on up the wider overhanging crack to a ledge and climb awkwardly out to the R up the narrow ramp above. The fun begins when you get to the base of the narrow, R-facing corner, which you climb on large 'soft' holds to the top. White Sea Horse VS 4b 35m This is the main central corner which you climb directly till you get to the loose part near the top. From there traverse carefully L and finish up a narrow, R-facing corner. ==Southern Flank== Goldener Oktober VS 4b 40m This takes the first corner on the Southern Flank, R of the central corner. When abbing down keep L of a small pillarand belay on a large black ledge, 8m above the sea. It's also advisable, nay, imperative, to use the ab rope for the last, exceedingly loose, 10m of the route. Climb up the corner on good holds passing two bulgesand, after 25m, move 2m L to an arete. On up steeply from here to a grassy ledge where you haul yourself up the rope. ==Great Wall Area== In the centre of this section there is an area of vegetation and loose rock before the second corner R of the main central split. To the R of this again is the impressive Great Wall, 40m of smooth dark rock, bounded on the R by a sharp arete. Further R is a third corner with a large overhang at mid-height. The routes here are in magnificent situations and of excellent quality but the top 10m of unidenified material requires a gentle hand. Thunderbirds E2 5b 40m A superb,sustained and direct line that climbs up the wall to the R of the quartz groove that runs up two-thirds of the cliff. Ab down to the R of the arete and swing L to a belay point on footholds, 5m below the overhang that crosses the base of the cliff (peg runner). From here climb up to and over a little corner in the overhang to gain a thin crack on the wall above. Climb the crack, with a slight diversion L to where it closes just above a small quartzy patch at mid-height. Step R to another crack and up steeply to better holds., before moving back L again to continue up the original line. The holds get increasingly larger here, but once you reach the slightly overhanging barm brack you trend gently R up to a protruding block near the arete, which is followed to the top. Brains E2 5b 40m An excellent companion to 'Thunderbirds' with which it shares the peg belay. Traverse R from the belay under the overhang to a short, leaning wall. The crux moves are up this to gain a spectacular position on the short arete on the R. Follow this to the wall just R of the of the main arete of Great Wall, where a thin crack brings you to a ledge on that arete. Continue up, keeping more or less to the arete until you reach a short groove where the arete becomes loose and overhung, about 10m from the top. Step onto the L wall and climb carefully past a projecting block."

It consists of a large promontory connected to the mainland at Béal an Mhuirthead (Belmullet) by a narrow isthmus. Dún na mBó is due west of Béal an Mhuirthead. ===Getting there=== Starting from American Street in Béal an Mhuirhead turn left onto R313. Drive along the strand and take the first turn right. Follow this to a church on the left side and 300m after this take the road on the right/ straight ahead. Follow this to turn right for at a sign for Dún na mBóó. The crag is about 30m beyond the Dún na mBó Blowhole. It is identified by being exactly opposite a large 60m x 30m rock out to sea which is joined to the crag by a shelf. Abseil down to a small platform in a corner and this will provide standing space for up to three persons. The crag is south facing, rock (schist) is clean and of high quality friction. Description sent in reads \"reasonable top protection for leader, but not a lot of climb protection\". The rock is considered to be pretty sound, is mainly of horizontal cracks, shelves and steps, but not a lot of protection. 1/. Spider's Fall S 20m G. O'Neill, C. Lynch 8.4.94 Start from the platform and move directly up into corner about 3m. Protection point. Traverse left out into the exposed face over a quartzite patch. Move upward along a vertical break to another horizontal crack and continue to the top by the left side of a vertical flake. 2/. Oakwood Revisited V. Diff 20m J. Tracey 8.4.94 From the platform, move up the corner on the left side of the small arete which becomes easier towards the top where large steps remove the buzz from the climb. 3/. Beaty's Brainy Brother HS 4b 22m M. Tracey, G. O'Neill 8.4.94 From the platform move move to the right face by moving up to the overhanging block. Surmount this block and continue to the top directly via a series of horizontal cracks. No protection. 4/. Beavis and Butthead HS 4b 22m G. O'Neill (solo) 9.4.94 Start as for Beaty's Brainy Brother but, from the overhanging block move out right to below the nose and climb up and out to the edge of this nose and directly to top. 5/. Spookey sounds V. Diff M. Tracey, 8.4.94 As for Oakwood Revisited, but continue the route up to the right side of the small arete. 6/. Left out in 90 S M. Tracey, D. Tracey, 8.4.94 Start climb from platform directly up the face on the left side of the corner. Continue up about 15m to a horizontal crack which goes directly to the lower part of the top nose of the face. Lay back up seaward facing flake to the top. 7/. Itchy and Scratchy HS M. Tracey, G. O'Neill 8.4.94 Climb as per Left out in 90 but about 10m up, commence a traverse towards the top of the lower nose to a horizontal crack. Climb upward via this crack to where 2 further cracks are found. Take the right crack to the top. 8/ Dumplings and Acne VS 4c 25m M. Tracey, 8.4.94 Start at the platform and move rightward along a 45 degree shelf under the overhangs until you reach the edge which now turns towards the entrance to the blowhole. Climb upwards to an area of orange lichen. The face now consists of small overhangs and shelves, with handholds which are rounded and less punitive. Climb to top past patch of quartzite."

            "description": "The centre of the crag is split by an obvious dirty groove, usually seeping. This route takes the broad slab left of the groove and finishes up an obvious crack in the steep headwall. A band of overhangs traverses across the bottom half of the slabs. Belay on a small ledge below the dirty groove at the left-hand side of the widest part of the overhangs. HELLSFIRE 43m E1 5a This route starts as for Freaghillaun and takes the slab between the dirty groove and Pathfinder. Start at the base of the dirty groove at the left edge of the widest part of the overhang. Move right across the slab above the wide overhang to a ledge at the base of a vegetated groove. Continue up rightwards on steepening lichenous rock to a vague diagonal crack, hidden in the lichen and climb directly up the overhanging wall above on increasingly large holds to finish at a cleaned ledge at the top. Excellent exhilarating climbing. PATHFINDER 43m HVS The green lichenous slabs visible from the car park are best viewed from a small promontory just opposite the slab. They are bordered on the right side by a prominent arête and a band of stepwise overhangs crosses the slab from right to left. This route takes the broad slab left of the groove and finishes up an obvious crack in the steep headwall. A band of overhangs traverses across the bottom half of the slabs. Belay on a small ledge below the dirty groove at the left-hand side of the widest part of the overhangs. Pathfinder takes the slab on the right of the dirty groove.Move up left over the overhang. Continue leftwards, up the lichenous slab to reach the crack near the top. Climb steeply up this. Poor protection. Stake belay. CLEO 43m HVS 4c This route takes a thin crack in the slab just left of the arête, about 7m. right of Pathfinder. Towards the top it climbs the vertical headwall just right of the final groove of Pathfinder. Abseil down and belay on a small ledge below the overlap and 1m. left of the arête. Climb up to the overlap and gain the slab above. Ascend the thin crack until it runs out and up right to a small ledge just left of the arête and below a small overlap. Step up and follow holds left until it is possible to move back right to a deep diagonal crack below the steeper headwall. Hand-traverse left to below a short thin black crack. Climb steeply past the crack and trend up left (avoiding easy ground on the left) to quartz veins. Continue up steeply, trending left, to the top of the groove of Pathfinder. The top of this route offers very strenuous and spectacular, if somewhat contrived, climbing. Small friends and tricams necessary to protect the top section of the route. SEA QUEEN 43m VS 4b Takes the obvious arête bordering the right-hand side of the crag. Start as for Cleo on a ledge below the overhang at the bottom of the arête. Avoid the overhang by first moving right and then left above it. Climb pleasantly up the left side of the arête to a small ledge below a small overlap (shared with Cleo). Step right onto the arête and up this to a ledge with suspect rock below an overhanging groove. Climb the groove on large holds to the top. (Very little protection on the arête). The next route is on the third area of slabs SKYLARK 76m HS 3c This route takes the obvious left-trending diagonal crack on the third area of slabs east of Danish Cellar. Abseil down to a palatial ledge just below an overhang (wooden stake in place; it may be rotten). The climb provides magnificent situations and exposure for the grade. 1. 43m. . Traverse leftwards around the overhang and then up and right to the crack. Follow this to a belay. 2. 43m. Follow the crack and jugs almost to the top. Avoid the grassy finish by traversing left to huge holds on an arête. Stake belay in place. ====An Uaich Bhuí - Aill Thuaidh==== Access is 20 minutes or so. Follow the Erris Head Loop clockwise across fields and open land from the roadhead on the shore of An Siolar (Danish Cellar) until it is time to branch off left as shown in the diagram at the top of the page. This is a west-facing sea cliff (An Éadan Thiar) about 35m high divided by two enormous vertical fault-lines or chasms into three distinct buttresses as shown above and a south-facing sea cliff (The Petrified Wave). Access to the climbing is by a descending ramp to the left for the Éadan ar Clé and Éadan Lárach. The ramp is utterly impassable as between the Éadan Lárach and the Éadan ar Dheis. Abseiling is relevant where some may prefer to leave a fixed abseil in position to facilitate (for instance) multiple parties accessing multiple climbs on the Éadan Lárach, in preference to the walk around. Base Camp is a matter of choice, but the ramp on Éadan ar Clé, just where the other Buttresses come into view, has become popular. All directions are given as though looking at the rock from seaward. The rock is foliated gneiss. =====An Éadan ar Clé===== This mainly faces west but also south, where the ramp and also a lower ramp turn inwards / east just before it reaches an Éadan Lárach. Routes are accessed easily by scrambling steeply down a ramp from top left of the access ramp."

            "description": "This route takes a thin crack in the slab just left of the arête, about 7m. right of Pathfinder. Towards the top it climbs the vertical headwall just right of the final groove of Pathfinder. Abseil down and belay on a small ledge below the overlap and 1m. left of the arête. Climb up to the overlap and gain the slab above. Ascend the thin crack until it runs out and up right to a small ledge just left of the arête and below a small overlap. Step up and follow holds left until it is possible to move back right to a deep diagonal crack below the steeper headwall. Hand-traverse left to below a short thin black crack. Climb steeply past the crack and trend up left (avoiding easy ground on the left) to quartz veins. Continue up steeply, trending left, to the top of the groove of Pathfinder. The top of this route offers very strenuous and spectacular, if somewhat contrived, climbing. Small friends and tricams necessary to protect the top section of the route. SEA QUEEN 43m VS 4b Takes the obvious arête bordering the right-hand side of the crag. Start as for Cleo on a ledge below the overhang at the bottom of the arête. Avoid the overhang by first moving right and then left above it. Climb pleasantly up the left side of the arête to a small ledge below a small overlap (shared with Cleo). Step right onto the arête and up this to a ledge with suspect rock below an overhanging groove. Climb the groove on large holds to the top. (Very little protection on the arête). The next route is on the third area of slabs SKYLARK 76m HS 3c This route takes the obvious left-trending diagonal crack on the third area of slabs east of Danish Cellar. Abseil down to a palatial ledge just below an overhang (wooden stake in place; it may be rotten). The climb provides magnificent situations and exposure for the grade. 1. 43m. . Traverse leftwards around the overhang and then up and right to the crack. Follow this to a belay. 2. 43m. Follow the crack and jugs almost to the top. Avoid the grassy finish by traversing left to huge holds on an arête. Stake belay in place. ====An Uaich Bhuí - Aill Thuaidh==== Access is 20 minutes or so. Follow the Erris Head Loop clockwise across fields and open land from the roadhead on the shore of An Siolar (Danish Cellar) until it is time to branch off left as shown in the diagram at the top of the page. This is a west-facing sea cliff (An Éadan Thiar) about 35m high divided by two enormous vertical fault-lines or chasms into three distinct buttresses as shown above and a south-facing sea cliff (The Petrified Wave). Access to the climbing is by a descending ramp to the left for the Éadan ar Clé and Éadan Lárach. The ramp is utterly impassable as between the Éadan Lárach and the Éadan ar Dheis. Abseiling is relevant where some may prefer to leave a fixed abseil in position to facilitate (for instance) multiple parties accessing multiple climbs on the Éadan Lárach, in preference to the walk around. Base Camp is a matter of choice, but the ramp on Éadan ar Clé, just where the other Buttresses come into view, has become popular. All directions are given as though looking at the rock from seaward. The rock is foliated gneiss. =====An Éadan ar Clé===== This mainly faces west but also south, where the ramp and also a lower ramp turn inwards / east just before it reaches an Éadan Lárach. Routes are accessed easily by scrambling steeply down a ramp from top left of the access ramp."

            "description": "A demanding and complex climb mostly following the abseil line. Start at the lowest point of the wall at the toe of the base slab. A short ridge above a trench into the sea provides a non-tidal position to belay. 1. 20m, 4b Climb up the slab for 10m then up an obvious corner-crack to belay on the higher slab/ break line under the overhanging section of the wall. 2. 30m, 5c The steepest pitch. Move 2m left then up into a short hanging corner. Almost immediately move left into a second hanging corner then up this to its capping roof. (This point is just below the 'beak' feature). Use undercuts and the fin on the left to make wild moves over the roof. Move up and right on less steep rock to a quartz break (directly right of the 'beak') then traverse back above the 'beak' on top of the quartz break for about 4m to a stance, trying to avoid rope-drag. 3. 25m, 5b/c The boldest pitch. Climb the open groove above the belay into a zone of juggy quartz rock. Continue into a more pronounced groove with some hard, poorly protected climbing. Before the top of the groove exit right onto the right arete which forms a vague ledge. Make a technical crawl leftwards on this ledge to a sloping stance above and left of the groove. 4. 35m, 6a Follow the blocky crack and flake line above the belay for 10m to the obvious line of rightwards trending overhangs. Traverse under the overhangs rightwards to a good ledge. Move up into the corner above which becomes progressively harder culminating in a very thin move up onto the upper ramp. Scramble up the ramp to belay on the abseil rope. [5.] 10m. Finish by jumaring up the abseil rope. The corner to the right above the ramp has been top-roped at about VS but is very loose. Dan believes the route to be easier than E5 but was climbing very strongly at the time .... individual pitches might only be E3-E4 but overall this route is substantial. ==The Razor Strap== The Razor Strap is the local name for the very obvious slab above the stacks in the middle of the Main Cliffs. Abseil 75m from assorted stakes to grass ledges below the slab. The Strop 90m E1 A straightforward but sensationally-positioned climb. Much of the climbing is HVS, or easier, and well-protected. Bring a wide range of cams. Start from the lowest point of the slab. 1. 40m, 5a Follow a sequence of disconnected cracks up the slab, meeting the left arete briefly then slightly rightwards until the cracks end in a shallow corner. Up the corner then exit rightwards onto a grass ledge. 2. 35m, 5c Make thin moves up hair-line cracks above the stance (keeping out of the 'grass caterpillar' to the right), passing an in-situ peg. Easier ground is reached after 8m. Move left to the obvious diagonal wide crack system. Follow this for 20m then make a short traverse left to an obvious and extremely exposed stance on the left arete. Belay anchors in the corner crack behind. 3. 15m, 5a Follow the corner to the top. Rusty stakes in-situ near to the top of this route do show that some kind of previous attempt has taken place. However the main part of the slab required extensive cleaning and it has been verified with the stake-placers that the route had not been climbed. ==The Altar== The Altar is a prominent and peculiar flat-grass-topped buttress on the north side of the bay formed by Dromore Head and another peninsula to the south. Scramble down the loose gully on the east side of the buttress to reach sea-level. Spume Storm 45m VS 4a Follow the obvious crack in the south-facing slab close to the left arête, passing an overlap carefully at two thirds height. Pull one rope up to reach belays well back. ==Dromore Head== image:dromore.jpg Dromore Head is the distinct ridge, clearly marked on maps, at the furthest south-west point of the island. The very end of the ridge forms a knife-edge with a very fine 45m slab on its south face and a steeper wall to the west. To access all the routes, abseil down the south face to non-tidal ledges at the slab's base. Okurano 40m E1 5b An exciting route following the final crack, just before the left-hand arête of the slab. Start in a chimney, then continue in the same line to where the crack splits the obvious overlap. Make steep moves through the overlap, then finish more easily up the hanging slab above. Spectacular but easier than it looks. Migi No Ho 40m E3 6a The weakness in the overlap to the right. Approach via a thin crack in the slab below keeping away from the easier corner system to the right. Tough moves through the overlap lead to an easier finish up the hanging slab above. To the right the slab lies back at an easier angle: New Schedules 45m Severe The third (from the right) crack. The Cleggan-Roonah Rally 45m Severe The second (from the right) crack. Kneel Before The Ferryman 45m VS 4c The rightmost crack on the slab, with a crux section around half-height in a quartz-lined groove. ==West Face== Scramble around from the south face to the base of the west-facing wall. The main feature of the wall is a leftwards slanting crack: Trapped Nerve 35m E2 Very fine climbing on perfect rock. Low in the grade. 1. 25m, 5b Follow the crack to a large ledge. 2. 10m, 5b Move up and back on to the front face. Climb the exposed face direct to the apex of the wall."

            "description": "Seen from the Connemara or Mayo coast Inishturk appears rather flat, especially compared to Clare Island to its north. This view is deceptive: the high point of the island is over 200m and the hidden western coast is an almost continuous line of cliffs. The cliffs reach their highest point at the right-angled cutaway at the north-west of the island maintaining a vertical profile of 120-170m for almost 1km. This 'Main Cliffs' area is an exceptional and intimidating place. The structure is reminiscent of parts of the South Stack at Gogarth in Wales or Tintagel Head in Cornwall, though on a far grander scale. Two multi-pitch routes have been climbed so far here and there is scope for many more. Elsewhere on the island there are several other major features. The north-east coast has a very steep wall and the interesting 'Perrin Zawn'. On the west coast the crags become smaller forming a complex system of small bays and zawns, offering extensive scope for single pitch routes. The western tip is Dromore Head, the only other area developed so far, with excellent solid wall and slab climbing below a dramatic knife-edge ridge. Rock type is a variety of Ordovician sedimentary layers (sandstones, slates) similar to those found around Killary Harbour on the mainland. There also appear to be some igneous rock intrusions. ==Practicalities== The compact nature of the island means that all the crags may be reached by foot. The Main Cliffs are 40 minutes from the harbour and Dromore Head a little further. There is no shop but there is a bar in the community centre. The Harbour Lodge does evening meals. Finally, note that the weather on Inishturk is usually better than on the mainland. An on-line guide to the island with photo-topos for the routes is at http://www.foordkelcey.net/inishturk/ ==Midnight Wall== Midnight Wall is the clean, highly-featured crag at the far north end of the Main Cliffs underneath an obvious overhanging prow. A rightward-down-sloping ramp starting 10m down from the prow marks the top of the crag. A smaller vertical crag lies above that ramp. The base of the cliff is defined by a slab sloping up to the left. The base of the crag is reached by a 110m (100m is just adequate with a final down climb) abseil from stakes (not in place) and some rock anchors on top of the prow. The abseil rope should be dropped over an obvious notch in the south-west side of the prow. The rope will then hang just touching the edge of the upper ramp. Whilst abseiling try to locate an obvious quartz-tipped 'beak' feature protruding from the crag about 60m down close to the abseil line. The cliff turns overhanging below the 'beak' having been vertical above. Ataturk 120m E5 A demanding and complex climb mostly following the abseil line. Start at the lowest point of the wall at the toe of the base slab. A short ridge above a trench into the sea provides a non-tidal position to belay. 1. 20m, 4b Climb up the slab for 10m then up an obvious corner-crack to belay on the higher slab/ break line under the overhanging section of the wall. 2. 30m, 5c The steepest pitch. Move 2m left then up into a short hanging corner. Almost immediately move left into a second hanging corner then up this to its capping roof. (This point is just below the 'beak' feature). Use undercuts and the fin on the left to make wild moves over the roof. Move up and right on less steep rock to a quartz break (directly right of the 'beak') then traverse back above the 'beak' on top of the quartz break for about 4m to a stance, trying to avoid rope-drag. 3. 25m, 5b/c The boldest pitch. Climb the open groove above the belay into a zone of juggy quartz rock. Continue into a more pronounced groove with some hard, poorly protected climbing. Before the top of the groove exit right onto the right arete which forms a vague ledge. Make a technical crawl leftwards on this ledge to a sloping stance above and left of the groove. 4. 35m, 6a Follow the blocky crack and flake line above the belay for 10m to the obvious line of rightwards trending overhangs. Traverse under the overhangs rightwards to a good ledge. Move up into the corner above which becomes progressively harder culminating in a very thin move up onto the upper ramp. Scramble up the ramp to belay on the abseil rope. [5.] 10m. Finish by jumaring up the abseil rope. The corner to the right above the ramp has been top-roped at about VS but is very loose. Dan believes the route to be easier than E5 but was climbing very strongly at the time .... individual pitches might only be E3-E4 but overall this route is substantial. ==The Razor Strap== The Razor Strap is the local name for the very obvious slab above the stacks in the middle of the Main Cliffs. Abseil 75m from assorted stakes to grass ledges below the slab. The Strop 90m E1 A straightforward but sensationally-positioned climb. Much of the climbing is HVS, or easier, and well-protected. Bring a wide range of cams. Start from the lowest point of the slab. 1. 40m, 5a Follow a sequence of disconnected cracks up the slab, meeting the left arete briefly then slightly rightwards until the cracks end in a shallow corner. Up the corner then exit rightwards onto a grass ledge. 2. 35m, 5c Make thin moves up hair-line cracks above the stance (keeping out of the 'grass caterpillar' to the right), passing an in-situ peg. Easier ground is reached after 8m. Move left to the obvious diagonal wide crack system. Follow this for 20m then make a short traverse left to an obvious and extremely exposed stance on the left arete. Belay anchors in the corner crack behind. 3. 15m, 5a Follow the corner to the top. Rusty stakes in-situ near to the top of this route do show that some kind of previous attempt has taken place. However the main part of the slab required extensive cleaning and it has been verified with the stake-placers that the route had not been climbed. ==The Altar== The Altar is a prominent and peculiar flat-grass-topped buttress on the north side of the bay formed by Dromore Head and another peninsula to the south. Scramble down the loose gully on the east side of the buttress to reach sea-level. Spume Storm 45m VS 4a Follow the obvious crack in the south-facing slab close to the left arête, passing an overlap carefully at two thirds height. Pull one rope up to reach belays well back. ==Dromore Head== image:dromore.jpg Dromore Head is the distinct ridge, clearly marked on maps, at the furthest south-west point of the island. The very end of the ridge forms a knife-edge with a very fine 45m slab on its south face and a steeper wall to the west. To access all the routes, abseil down the south face to non-tidal ledges at the slab's base. Okurano 40m E1 5b An exciting route following the final crack, just before the left-hand arête of the slab. Start in a chimney, then continue in the same line to where the crack splits the obvious overlap. Make steep moves through the overlap, then finish more easily up the hanging slab above. Spectacular but easier than it looks. Migi No Ho 40m E3 6a The weakness in the overlap to the right. Approach via a thin crack in the slab below keeping away from the easier corner system to the right. Tough moves through the overlap lead to an easier finish up the hanging slab above. To the right the slab lies back at an easier angle: New Schedules 45m Severe The third (from the right) crack. The Cleggan-Roonah Rally 45m Severe The second (from the right) crack. Kneel Before The Ferryman 45m VS 4c The rightmost crack on the slab, with a crux section around half-height in a quartz-lined groove. ==West Face== Scramble around from the south face to the base of the west-facing wall. The main feature of the wall is a leftwards slanting crack: Trapped Nerve 35m E2 Very fine climbing on perfect rock. Low in the grade. 1. 25m, 5b Follow the crack to a large ledge. 2. 10m, 5b Move up and back on to the front face. Climb the exposed face direct to the apex of the wall."

Stand on boulder, pull up into the chimney, and continue to a ledge on the right (belay below and to the right). 2. 12m. Traverse across the wall to the right, and climb a short slab (utilising the crack between the slab and the wall on its left) to a ledge. Climb the wall above the ledge, bearing left (or move right to climb an easier wall and traverse back left) to reach a belay on the crest of the rib. 3. 17m. Climb the slabby rib on its right edge. At the top it is necessary to traverse delicately left to avoid a 'cornice\" of dry moss, and reach a grassy step in the rib. Peg belay used. 4. 21m. Climb the quartz-marked slab rather delicately for 15m. to a grass ledge, then continue up an easier slab to a grass ledge and belay. The second (central) rib is: BLACK BESS 45m VDiff Start in a vegetative corner to the left of a large slab. 1. 14m. Climb this corner to enter an obvious chimney. Climb the chimney and exit on left to a large ledge. 2. 17m. Climb the slab above for 4m. and then gain arête. Continue up arête to belay on large grass ledge. 3. 14m. Continue up arête to finish behind large block. Scramble up to easier ground. The slab on the right of the Central Rib is: S.O.S. 36m VDiff 1. 18m. Start up the greasy slab, moving diagonally right. Gain access to a good crack moving left, and continue to grassy ledge with good stance and belay. 2. 18m. Straight up to a good flake, and move left around a large bulge. Continue straight up to grassy bank and belay (some loose blocks). AENGUS 61m VDiff Route takes the 3rd (left) rib (arête to left of Black Bess). Start by traversing awkward gully left of heather ledge. 1. 20m. Climb arête easily until reach vertical wall. Move right and pull up over block. Belay on block. 2. 36m. Climb crack for 2m. traverse right (protection poor) to regain edge of arête, continue up arête to veg. ledge belay (hard to find) or continue up belay 9m. above. 3. 5m. Scramble to top. The main cliffs at the back of the corrie are divided vertically into three sections. The section to the left of the main gully is at the steepest average angle, but it is not continuous and there is much vegetation. ROUTE 1 and ROUTE 2 lie on this section. To the right of the gully, the steep rock is less continuous, but there are some fine pieces of rock, including THE AIGUILLE, an obvious pinnacle which is in the centre at about half height. The second two lines lie on this central portion. There is another gully to the right of this central mass, and there are some fine ranges of cliff to the right of this gully, but these had not been attempted at the time of these climbs. (I have no record of names having been given to these climbs, which were done as mountaineering routes up this large cliff. F.W.) ROUTE 1 70m S This route and the next take a line up the face to the left of the main gully referred to above. They lead fairly directly towards the first summit on the Ben Lug More Ridge. There is a deep watercourse in the scree to the left of the main gully. Above this is a large helmet-shaped buttress below a wide-open gully ending in overhangs (there are two other helmet-shaped buttresses between this and the main gully to the right). Start directly below the wide-open gully, and zigzag up moderate rock and steep vegetation to the base of this gully (about 120m). A great slab runs out left from the gully base. This route and the next were taken up this slab. 1. 10m. Move out left towards a vegetated chimney. Belay at the base of a line of weakness running up the slab. 2. 25m. Straight up on good holds. Piton belay. 3. 35m. Continue up on smaller holds to reach a vegetated ledge. This route and the next re-join on a vegetated rake which is followed up diagonally leftwards for at least 150m to reach the top of the cliff. ROUTE 2 D This route shares the start with the previous climb and follows the same line for about 120m to the base of the great slab running from the wide-open gully base. 1. 30m. Take the rib to the right of Route 1. Delicate and exposed, especially near the top. 2. 40m. Climb up the back of the gully, above a small waterfall, and then out right to the top. Very delicate and exposed. This route and the previous re-join on a vegetated rake which is followed up diagonally leftwards for at least 150m to reach the top of the cliff. THE AIGUILLE (an attempt) D The Aiguille is an obvious pinnacle which lies about half way up the cliff, about half way between the main gully and the next substantial gully to the right. An attempt on this is recorded since it seems to have been the first attempt on the high cliff at Doolough. Very wet conditions contributed to the failure. To reach the start of the climb, climb about 150m of slabs and very loose vegetation (this vegetation had recently been burned and may normally be less unstable). The climbing starts below the front face of The Aiguille, where a groove runs to a ledge. 1. 35m. Hard. Climb slab to the right of the groove and traverse into it. Climb to the ledge and traverse to its left end. 2. 20m. Up edge on outside, traverse back right and climb cracks (loose rock) to reach a ledge."

Climb crack for 2m. traverse right (protection poor) to regain edge of arête, continue up arête to veg. ledge belay (hard to find) or continue up belay 9m. above. 3. 5m. Scramble to top. The main cliffs at the back of the corrie are divided vertically into three sections. The section to the left of the main gully is at the steepest average angle, but it is not continuous and there is much vegetation. ROUTE 1 and ROUTE 2 lie on this section. To the right of the gully, the steep rock is less continuous, but there are some fine pieces of rock, including THE AIGUILLE, an obvious pinnacle which is in the centre at about half height. The second two lines lie on this central portion. There is another gully to the right of this central mass, and there are some fine ranges of cliff to the right of this gully, but these had not been attempted at the time of these climbs. (I have no record of names having been given to these climbs, which were done as mountaineering routes up this large cliff. F.W.) ROUTE 1 70m S This route and the next take a line up the face to the left of the main gully referred to above. They lead fairly directly towards the first summit on the Ben Lug More Ridge. There is a deep watercourse in the scree to the left of the main gully. Above this is a large helmet-shaped buttress below a wide-open gully ending in overhangs (there are two other helmet-shaped buttresses between this and the main gully to the right). Start directly below the wide-open gully, and zigzag up moderate rock and steep vegetation to the base of this gully (about 120m). A great slab runs out left from the gully base. This route and the next were taken up this slab. 1. 10m. Move out left towards a vegetated chimney. Belay at the base of a line of weakness running up the slab. 2. 25m. Straight up on good holds. Piton belay. 3. 35m. Continue up on smaller holds to reach a vegetated ledge. This route and the next re-join on a vegetated rake which is followed up diagonally leftwards for at least 150m to reach the top of the cliff. ROUTE 2 D This route shares the start with the previous climb and follows the same line for about 120m to the base of the great slab running from the wide-open gully base. 1. 30m. Take the rib to the right of Route 1. Delicate and exposed, especially near the top. 2. 40m. Climb up the back of the gully, above a small waterfall, and then out right to the top. Very delicate and exposed. This route and the previous re-join on a vegetated rake which is followed up diagonally leftwards for at least 150m to reach the top of the cliff. THE AIGUILLE (an attempt) D The Aiguille is an obvious pinnacle which lies about half way up the cliff, about half way between the main gully and the next substantial gully to the right. An attempt on this is recorded since it seems to have been the first attempt on the high cliff at Doolough. Very wet conditions contributed to the failure. To reach the start of the climb, climb about 150m of slabs and very loose vegetation (this vegetation had recently been burned and may normally be less unstable). The climbing starts below the front face of The Aiguille, where a groove runs to a ledge. 1. 35m. Hard. Climb slab to the right of the groove and traverse into it. Climb to the ledge and traverse to its left end. 2. 20m. Up edge on outside, traverse back right and climb cracks (loose rock) to reach a ledge."

The cliff to the left of An Bóthar Fada has huge overhangs and walls, many of which are dripping wet, which may provide challenging routes for the future. Ailltreacha Lug Mhór These are the cliffs on the north side of the glen.There is a big south facing slab on the center of it and from a distance it looks to have an overhang across it about one third of the way up. The climb generally takes the left hand side of the slab. High up the valley there are two slabs, close together, which are particularly noticeable. From a distance the one on the right looks completely smooth, while the one on the left is more broken, with a clear Y marking high up. They are about half mile (and a good half hour's thrutch) beyond An Bóthar Fada. SLÍBHÍN 125 m. v diff. Start at the lowest point of the slab below a block 15m above. 1. 40m. v diff.

Climb on up taking the best climbing ground,Probably 2 or 3 metres in from the edge at times to the top of the slab. Continue up over blocks for 15 metres and belay to a large detached block. (Large sling) The next slab to the left of Slíbhín is vegetated with a clean right hand side below a head wall running its lent. This is a water drain and needs a dry spell to be at its best for climbing. Leach Frithchuimilte has excellent rock but its top pitch can hold rock washed over the top after winter storms. LEAC FRITHCHUIMILTE 175m. VS. 1.55m VS. Climb on good friction and small holds easy going for 15 m, continue on up with difficulty increasing with height and belay from chock stone jammed under head wall. 2. 30M. HS.

Climb the slabby nose, keeping left, then go up an easy-angled diedre to a belay above a small bulge. Beware loose rock! Grassy scrambling to the ridge (40m). CAPALL SUAS 180m Diff D. Short, J. Lynam, R. Lynam (leads shared). 2.6.86 Right of Stepped Edge, start just left of the stream which falls from the right-hand slab. 1. 45m. Climb the bulge and continue up the big slab (near its left edge) to an airy stance and belay. (Note: no runners were found on this pitch!). 2. 42m. Continue up the left side of the slab to a grassy saddle. Belay on rock wall behind. 3. 21m. Traverse right to gain the slab above the rock wall. Climb the slab diagonally right to a ledge beside the stream and below the second rock wall. 4. 32m. Climb straight up (loose rock) and traverse right (veg) to gain the slab above the second wall. Continue to belay in stream bed. 5. 40m. Climb up beside the stream until the rock peters out a few metres below the ridge. Note : For climbs of this grade there are notably few stances or even running belays. FROG BUTTRESS 254m V.Diff J. Forsythe, M. Forsythe. 12.7.86 Start : the first two slabs on the right entering the corries have a buttress lying between them, undercut at the bottom and on the left and with a grass ramp running from bottom right to bisect the left edge at mid-height, thus creating a stack of two buttresses. A rock tongue leads to the lower buttress. Climb the rock tongue, then steeper rock at 60m. turning it on the left, and cross the top of the grass ramp at 125m. The upper buttress gives easier climbing for 120m., with a cave at 75m. Descent to the right, under an impressive head wall. Ailltreacha Mám Trásna Up in the north west head of the glen the plateau coming down from Mám Trásna forms these cliffs. On Aill Mám Trásna is a broad 90 meter high slab with a step running left to right across it in its lower reaches. Scramble up to the foot of the slab coming in to it from the left. Fáinleog Bhán 90m HS. 1. 45n HS. Climb the slab from bottom to top keeping a central line. At the step find a very good large hex runner on its right side. Traverse back to center step up and continue up to broken section, nut belay. 2. 45m S. Keeping a central line the climbing gets easier as you move on up. ORANGE LODGE R. Cole, V. Cregan, M.
