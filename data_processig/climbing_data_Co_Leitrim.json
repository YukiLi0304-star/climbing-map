Hard thin climbing on adequate (small) gear leads to easier climbing above. Pass 1 RB and launch upwards through the overhang to the anchors 2 RB’s.

It is (approx) 60-70 m high and about 400m long. There are sections of good clean rock, mixed with sections of choss. A deep corner splits the face into two obvious sectors, the right of which offers somewhat less climbing options, it seems. The climbing developed thus far is on the face to the left of the corner. The first 4 routes climb the longest clean section of face with the least amount of broken ground. The face gets morning sun, and whilst the rock is quick to dry after rain, the cracks can remain slimy for longer. Still, warm, cloudy weather equals lots of midges! Routes described left to right. 1- EAGLES HIGH - E3/4 6a The first line that was done on the main wall. Climb up and left from the base of TRIGGER HIPPY until under the obvious crackline that runs all the way to the left side of grassy ledge where a ‘triangular block’ sits 5 meters from the very top.

            "description": "====THE MAIN FACE- Left==== The main face is THE reason to climb here. It is (approx) 60-70 m high and about 400m long. There are sections of good clean rock, mixed with sections of choss. A deep corner splits the face into two obvious sectors, the right of which offers somewhat less climbing options, it seems. The climbing developed thus far is on the face to the left of the corner. The first 4 routes climb the longest clean section of face with the least amount of broken ground. The face gets morning sun, and whilst the rock is quick to dry after rain, the cracks can remain slimy for longer. Still, warm, cloudy weather equals lots of midges! Routes described left to right. 1- EAGLES HIGH - E3/4 6a The first line that was done on the main wall. Climb up and left from the base of TRIGGER HIPPY until under the obvious crackline that runs all the way to the left side of grassy ledge where a ‘triangular block’ sits 5 meters from the very top. (When standing back from the wall this block looks like an eagles head).Launch straight up past some bold wall climbing, past an obvious horizontal break, and up the crack to belay ledge (2 RB’s). Follow the crack to finish. A bit dirty, but nice. (E2 5b) 2- TRIGGER HIPPY - E2 5b, 7a+? * (Awaiting grade confirmation) Climbs the obvious crack that continues from the top of a right facing corner/pillar. Nice crack climbing to belay (2 RB’s). Sport Pitch- From here, a few hard moves (crux) leads to another ledge (and belay- ignore this!) and forage a way up the wall above. Nice face climbing. 3- 21st CENTURY FOX – E4 6a * About 5 meters right of Trigger Hippy 2 cracks almost meet at ground level. The left hand one gives hard, thin climbing. Climb through the steep lower section to easier ground and a grassy ledge. Climb the right leaning corner to belay (2RB’s). Step left, clip one RB and launch upwards through 2 more small roofs to end on the right of grassy ledge. Sustained. RP’S, small/med wires, and small cams. 4- WAYFERER – unclimbed The right of the two cracks that almost form a V at ground level. 5- E3 5b Climbs the groove 15 m right of WAYFERER Kev Power on the first ascent of an E3 5b on the main face of Cloonty Pruglish THE MAIN FACE-Right to be continued………"

            "description": "It is very important when climbing any route on Swiss Valley to be careful not to dislodge or throw rocks down into the valley where they may kill or injure the grazing sheep or occasional hillwalkers. The steep grassy slopes mean that any rock fall will bounce all the way to the other side of the valley floor. This also means that if you drop your phone while taking a selfie you can forget about retrieving it from the bottom because it could have ended up anywhere. A 50m absail will get you to the belay spots. Bringing an extra bit of rope to make an anchor makes things smoother but not essential. The last couple meters of routes (apart from Enigma and Prime Lime which as clean to the top) can be a bit grassy but not too bad as far as Irish standard go. Easily avoidable by pulling on the ab rope once grass starts but there is enough solid rock in the grassy part to climb as well. The access from the top couldn't be easier. You can drive up a forestry road to the top of the mountain and walk 15min to the first route. There are laybys all along the road up that you can use.
