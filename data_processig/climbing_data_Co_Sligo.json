            "description": "This is the first large corner right of the descent.Gain height for 10m until you arrive at the top. Limpet Line VD. Start 2m R of Second Movement and climb on flat holds to the top. Well, Well VD Start 4m L of the large recess containing Numero Uno and Doyle's Corner, at the foot of a narrow R-facing wall. Climb the centre of the wall to the top. Chiton Class VD Start just R of Well, Well and climb the face at right-angles to that route. Bridge Out VD Start 2m R of Chiton Class and climb up to and through a corner. NUMERO UNO S Just R of Bridge Out is a large recessed wall with an overhang at 4m and two opposing corners.This route goes up a slippery slab to the base of the left hand corner of the recess and straight up. DOYLE'S CORNER D This route takes the right hand corner of the recess used by Numero Uno. Mussel On VS 4b Start 2 m R of Doyle's Corner, beneath an overhang at half-height. Climb direct to the top. Pilgrims M.S. Start 2m R of Mussel On and climb direct to top. AVOIDING THE OBVIOUS HS 4b 13m right of Doyle's Corner there is a deep groove which overhangs at 1/4 and 2/3 height, with white moss at its base. Start up the groove but trend left after 2m to a corner and go straight up. ON THE BEACH HS 4b Once again start up the white mossed groove but rather than Avoiding The Obvious go left at the first overhang, back right again and then left at the second overhang. Via Media HS 4a Start as for Guido Doylo, but move L after 2m and climb diagonally L to finish up the corner L of Guido Doylo. GUIDO DOYLO VS 4b This is 4m right of the Avoiding The Obvious groove, and directly under a right facing V groove at the top. Start at a small overhang with a crack and climb direct to the groove and thence the top. WHITE STAIN ON A BLACK HEAD VS 4b Start 3m R of Guido Doylo at a small ledge which has a puddle 1m up and a white calcite stain at 3m which is 4m below a block with a crack on the right. Climb the overhangs to a shallow groove and finish up this. White Knight VS 4b Start just R of White Stain and climb steeply to a narrow ledge at 4m. Continue, bearing slightly L, to finish up 2m R of White Stain. MALLORY TOWERS HS 4b Start at the blocky arête right of WHITE STAIN on the right-hand side of the arête. Traverse left at 2m to the left hand side and then follow the arête to the top. WANDERLY WAGON HVS 5a The most unusual wagon you ever saw is to the left of a large rockfall scar where there is some lightly coloured rock. The route starts here and trends left to a triangular overhang. Swing around this on the left and on up to the top. The crux is at the bottom and after this the route gives easy climbing. BIM VS 4b Follow bulges (which bulges and where they are hasn't been alluded to) to a V slot at the top. PEABRAIN HVS 5a This route is right of the rockfall mentioned in Wanderly Wagon and takes a right trending line of short corners and finishes up left. There is a variation 4b finish which goes right in an airy position on good holds. SHEEG-SHAAG VS 4b A zigzag line running between Peabrain and Frog. FROG ON A COLD SLIMY ROOF HVS 5a Climb up from the left (of what I don't rightly know) to a large overhang at 4m and take it on the right. Go straight up over a smaller overhang. BLANCHE HVS 5a Possibly due to murky conditions, or some such atmospheric anomaly, the first ascensionists seem unable to indicate where this starts, your guess is as good as mine. Here it is, word for word. Follow the overhanging arête and grooves. Good route. THE MAD WART E1 5b Start at the bottomless groove of BAM but instead of pulling up into the groove, pull through the first roof just left of it. Long reaches gain positive holds. Finish up the easy corner. BAM E2 5b Follow the bottomless groove on the right of Blanche (ha haa haaa!). Go right at the roof above to gain a right facing groove shared with Radio Darren. An excellent route giving technical climbing on small holds lower down (crux) and climbing of a more strenuous nature higher up but on the characteristic Aughris 'bucket' holds. Low in the grade. RADIO DARREN HVS 5a Start just left of the first large area of green moss. Go through overhangs to finish up a right facing groove shared with Bam. PORPOISE HVS 5a Good wall climbing that's easier than it looks. Start 3m left of Grievous Bodily Charm and go left of a large roof, to trend rightwards up the wall to a small groove with an overhang at the top. GRIEVOUS BODILY CHARM E1 5b This starts below one of the few obvious features on the crag. Start below a large triangular roof at about 10m which has a crack running through it (takes Friend 3-3.5). Climb the arête to the roof and step out right into the bottom of a hanging corner on the right hand side of the roof. Here good friend protection can be arranged. Climb into the corner on small holds (crux) and go left up the wall above to the top. An excellent route with the crux being 'only' vertical and on small holds. UNFINISHED SYMPHONY HVS 4c To the right of Grevious Bodily Charm there is a large area of slime running the full height of the cliff, a first ascent is yet to be made. Unfinished Symphony is right of this and climbs between two green slimes - yummy ! The top half is unprotected. Go right up the wall to a right facing corner. SO LONG AND THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH E1 5b This route takes the dry overhanging wall to the left of Bem and to the right of a another slimy area. Fairly high in its grade. Go up left to a large overhang and take it directly. Continue straight up the wall surmounting smaller overhangs. Traverse right at the top to finish as for Bem. Superb climbing. BEM E1 5b A close relation to Bim and Bam, this route takes a series of shallow grooves through an obvious and impressive overhanging mini buttress just left of an area of more continuous slime. With it overhanging possibly 1 in 4 it looks intimidating but the climbing is more amenable than at first sight. Start at the right hand side of the buttress and trend left through a series of grooves to a resting ledge. Go straight up the overhanging groove and finish by trending left near the top, though trending right is also quite feasible. Finishes just right of a fence at the top which is a useful landmark. The crux is possibly near the bottom due to the start being a little slimy. An excellent exposed route on massive holds and low in the grade. These two routes are located at the first big inlet and start from just above a platform on the Eastern side. Abseil down to a small ledge 5m above the platform. SWING TIME E3 5c Takes the wall right of BEM where the slime almost runs the full height of the crag. Climb right of the streak on surprisingly dry rock. Steep and strenuous from the start. High on the right is a short green streak. Climb left of this. Good thread runner on the left. Step up and right once past the short green streak and finish on good holds with a massive pump. BOM VS 4c The last of the the B-specials climbs the right hand groove onto the wall and trends right following the contour of the cave to the top. DISAPPOINTING BASTILE VS 4c"

DOYLE'S CORNER D This route takes the right hand corner of the recess used by Numero Uno. Mussel On VS 4b Start 2 m R of Doyle's Corner, beneath an overhang at half-height. Climb direct to the top. Pilgrims M.S. Start 2m R of Mussel On and climb direct to top. AVOIDING THE OBVIOUS HS 4b 13m right of Doyle's Corner there is a deep groove which overhangs at 1/4 and 2/3 height, with white moss at its base. Start up the groove but trend left after 2m to a corner and go straight up. ON THE BEACH HS 4b Once again start up the white mossed groove but rather than Avoiding The Obvious go left at the first overhang, back right again and then left at the second overhang. Via Media HS 4a Start as for Guido Doylo, but move L after 2m and climb diagonally L to finish up the corner L of Guido Doylo. GUIDO DOYLO VS 4b This is 4m right of the Avoiding The Obvious groove, and directly under a right facing V groove at the top. Start at a small overhang with a crack and climb direct to the groove and thence the top. WHITE STAIN ON A BLACK HEAD VS 4b Start 3m R of Guido Doylo at a small ledge which has a puddle 1m up and a white calcite stain at 3m which is 4m below a block with a crack on the right. Climb the overhangs to a shallow groove and finish up this. White Knight VS 4b Start just R of White Stain and climb steeply to a narrow ledge at 4m. Continue, bearing slightly L, to finish up 2m R of White Stain. MALLORY TOWERS HS 4b Start at the blocky arête right of WHITE STAIN on the right-hand side of the arête. Traverse left at 2m to the left hand side and then follow the arête to the top. WANDERLY WAGON HVS 5a The most unusual wagon you ever saw is to the left of a large rockfall scar where there is some lightly coloured rock. The route starts here and trends left to a triangular overhang. Swing around this on the left and on up to the top. The crux is at the bottom and after this the route gives easy climbing. BIM VS 4b Follow bulges (which bulges and where they are hasn't been alluded to) to a V slot at the top. PEABRAIN HVS 5a This route is right of the rockfall mentioned in Wanderly Wagon and takes a right trending line of short corners and finishes up left. There is a variation 4b finish which goes right in an airy position on good holds. SHEEG-SHAAG VS 4b A zigzag line running between Peabrain and Frog. FROG ON A COLD SLIMY ROOF HVS 5a Climb up from the left (of what I don't rightly know) to a large overhang at 4m and take it on the right. Go straight up over a smaller overhang. BLANCHE HVS 5a Possibly due to murky conditions, or some such atmospheric anomaly, the first ascensionists seem unable to indicate where this starts, your guess is as good as mine. Here it is, word for word. Follow the overhanging arête and grooves. Good route. THE MAD WART E1 5b Start at the bottomless groove of BAM but instead of pulling up into the groove, pull through the first roof just left of it. Long reaches gain positive holds. Finish up the easy corner. BAM E2 5b Follow the bottomless groove on the right of Blanche (ha haa haaa!). Go right at the roof above to gain a right facing groove shared with Radio Darren. An excellent route giving technical climbing on small holds lower down (crux) and climbing of a more strenuous nature higher up but on the characteristic Aughris 'bucket' holds. Low in the grade. RADIO DARREN HVS 5a Start just left of the first large area of green moss. Go through overhangs to finish up a right facing groove shared with Bam. PORPOISE HVS 5a Good wall climbing that's easier than it looks. Start 3m left of Grievous Bodily Charm and go left of a large roof, to trend rightwards up the wall to a small groove with an overhang at the top. GRIEVOUS BODILY CHARM E1 5b This starts below one of the few obvious features on the crag. Start below a large triangular roof at about 10m which has a crack running through it (takes Friend 3-3.5). Climb the arête to the roof and step out right into the bottom of a hanging corner on the right hand side of the roof. Here good friend protection can be arranged. Climb into the corner on small holds (crux) and go left up the wall above to the top. An excellent route with the crux being 'only' vertical and on small holds. UNFINISHED SYMPHONY HVS 4c To the right of Grevious Bodily Charm there is a large area of slime running the full height of the cliff, a first ascent is yet to be made. Unfinished Symphony is right of this and climbs between two green slimes - yummy ! The top half is unprotected. Go right up the wall to a right facing corner. SO LONG AND THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH E1 5b This route takes the dry overhanging wall to the left of Bem and to the right of a another slimy area. Fairly high in its grade. Go up left to a large overhang and take it directly. Continue straight up the wall surmounting smaller overhangs. Traverse right at the top to finish as for Bem. Superb climbing. BEM E1 5b A close relation to Bim and Bam, this route takes a series of shallow grooves through an obvious and impressive overhanging mini buttress just left of an area of more continuous slime. With it overhanging possibly 1 in 4 it looks intimidating but the climbing is more amenable than at first sight. Start at the right hand side of the buttress and trend left through a series of grooves to a resting ledge. Go straight up the overhanging groove and finish by trending left near the top, though trending right is also quite feasible. Finishes just right of a fence at the top which is a useful landmark. The crux is possibly near the bottom due to the start being a little slimy. An excellent exposed route on massive holds and low in the grade. These two routes are located at the first big inlet and start from just above a platform on the Eastern side. Abseil down to a small ledge 5m above the platform. SWING TIME E3 5c Takes the wall right of BEM where the slime almost runs the full height of the crag. Climb right of the streak on surprisingly dry rock. Steep and strenuous from the start. High on the right is a short green streak. Climb left of this. Good thread runner on the left. Step up and right once past the short green streak and finish on good holds with a massive pump. BOM VS 4c The last of the the B-specials climbs the right hand groove onto the wall and trends right following the contour of the cave to the top. DISAPPOINTING BASTILE VS 4c"

GRIEVOUS BODILY CHARM E1 5b This starts below one of the few obvious features on the crag. Start below a large triangular roof at about 10m which has a crack running through it (takes Friend 3-3.5). Climb the arête to the roof and step out right into the bottom of a hanging corner on the right hand side of the roof. Here good friend protection can be arranged. Climb into the corner on small holds (crux) and go left up the wall above to the top. An excellent route with the crux being 'only' vertical and on small holds. UNFINISHED SYMPHONY HVS 4c To the right of Grevious Bodily Charm there is a large area of slime running the full height of the cliff, a first ascent is yet to be made. Unfinished Symphony is right of this and climbs between two green slimes - yummy ! The top half is unprotected. Go right up the wall to a right facing corner. SO LONG AND THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH E1 5b This route takes the dry overhanging wall to the left of Bem and to the right of a another slimy area. Fairly high in its grade. Go up left to a large overhang and take it directly. Continue straight up the wall surmounting smaller overhangs. Traverse right at the top to finish as for Bem. Superb climbing. BEM E1 5b A close relation to Bim and Bam, this route takes a series of shallow grooves through an obvious and impressive overhanging mini buttress just left of an area of more continuous slime. With it overhanging possibly 1 in 4 it looks intimidating but the climbing is more amenable than at first sight. Start at the right hand side of the buttress and trend left through a series of grooves to a resting ledge. Go straight up the overhanging groove and finish by trending left near the top, though trending right is also quite feasible. Finishes just right of a fence at the top which is a useful landmark. The crux is possibly near the bottom due to the start being a little slimy. An excellent exposed route on massive holds and low in the grade. These two routes are located at the first big inlet and start from just above a platform on the Eastern side. Abseil down to a small ledge 5m above the platform. SWING TIME E3 5c Takes the wall right of BEM where the slime almost runs the full height of the crag. Climb right of the streak on surprisingly dry rock. Steep and strenuous from the start. High on the right is a short green streak. Climb left of this. Good thread runner on the left. Step up and right once past the short green streak and finish on good holds with a massive pump. BOM VS 4c The last of the the B-specials climbs the right hand groove onto the wall and trends right following the contour of the cave to the top. DISAPPOINTING BASTILE VS 4c"

Start at the right hand side of the buttress and trend left through a series of grooves to a resting ledge. Go straight up the overhanging groove and finish by trending left near the top, though trending right is also quite feasible. Finishes just right of a fence at the top which is a useful landmark. The crux is possibly near the bottom due to the start being a little slimy. An excellent exposed route on massive holds and low in the grade. These two routes are located at the first big inlet and start from just above a platform on the Eastern side. Abseil down to a small ledge 5m above the platform. SWING TIME E3 5c Takes the wall right of BEM where the slime almost runs the full height of the crag. Climb right of the streak on surprisingly dry rock. Steep and strenuous from the start. High on the right is a short green streak. Climb left of this. Good thread runner on the left. Step up and right once past the short green streak and finish on good holds with a massive pump. BOM VS 4c The last of the the B-specials climbs the right hand groove onto the wall and trends right following the contour of the cave to the top. DISAPPOINTING BASTILE VS 4c"

WANDERLY WAGON HVS 5a The most unusual wagon you ever saw is to the left of a large rockfall scar where there is some lightly coloured rock. The route starts here and trends left to a triangular overhang. Swing around this on the left and on up to the top. The crux is at the bottom and after this the route gives easy climbing. BIM VS 4b Follow bulges (which bulges and where they are hasn't been alluded to) to a V slot at the top. PEABRAIN HVS 5a This route is right of the rockfall mentioned in Wanderly Wagon and takes a right trending line of short corners and finishes up left. There is a variation 4b finish which goes right in an airy position on good holds. SHEEG-SHAAG VS 4b A zigzag line running between Peabrain and Frog. FROG ON A COLD SLIMY ROOF HVS 5a Climb up from the left (of what I don't rightly know) to a large overhang at 4m and take it on the right. Go straight up over a smaller overhang. BLANCHE HVS 5a Possibly due to murky conditions, or some such atmospheric anomaly, the first ascensionists seem unable to indicate where this starts, your guess is as good as mine. Here it is, word for word. Follow the overhanging arête and grooves. Good route. THE MAD WART E1 5b Start at the bottomless groove of BAM but instead of pulling up into the groove, pull through the first roof just left of it. Long reaches gain positive holds. Finish up the easy corner. BAM E2 5b Follow the bottomless groove on the right of Blanche (ha haa haaa!). Go right at the roof above to gain a right facing groove shared with Radio Darren. An excellent route giving technical climbing on small holds lower down (crux) and climbing of a more strenuous nature higher up but on the characteristic Aughris 'bucket' holds. Low in the grade. RADIO DARREN HVS 5a Start just left of the first large area of green moss. Go through overhangs to finish up a right facing groove shared with Bam. PORPOISE HVS 5a Good wall climbing that's easier than it looks. Start 3m left of Grievous Bodily Charm and go left of a large roof, to trend rightwards up the wall to a small groove with an overhang at the top. GRIEVOUS BODILY CHARM E1 5b This starts below one of the few obvious features on the crag. Start below a large triangular roof at about 10m which has a crack running through it (takes Friend 3-3.5). Climb the arête to the roof and step out right into the bottom of a hanging corner on the right hand side of the roof. Here good friend protection can be arranged. Climb into the corner on small holds (crux) and go left up the wall above to the top. An excellent route with the crux being 'only' vertical and on small holds. UNFINISHED SYMPHONY HVS 4c To the right of Grevious Bodily Charm there is a large area of slime running the full height of the cliff, a first ascent is yet to be made. Unfinished Symphony is right of this and climbs between two green slimes - yummy ! The top half is unprotected. Go right up the wall to a right facing corner. SO LONG AND THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH E1 5b This route takes the dry overhanging wall to the left of Bem and to the right of a another slimy area. Fairly high in its grade. Go up left to a large overhang and take it directly. Continue straight up the wall surmounting smaller overhangs. Traverse right at the top to finish as for Bem. Superb climbing.

Here it is, word for word. Follow the overhanging arête and grooves. Good route. THE MAD WART E1 5b Start at the bottomless groove of BAM but instead of pulling up into the groove, pull through the first roof just left of it. Long reaches gain positive holds. Finish up the easy corner. BAM E2 5b Follow the bottomless groove on the right of Blanche (ha haa haaa!). Go right at the roof above to gain a right facing groove shared with Radio Darren. An excellent route giving technical climbing on small holds lower down (crux) and climbing of a more strenuous nature higher up but on the characteristic Aughris 'bucket' holds. Low in the grade. RADIO DARREN HVS 5a Start just left of the first large area of green moss. Go through overhangs to finish up a right facing groove shared with Bam. PORPOISE HVS 5a Good wall climbing that's easier than it looks. Start 3m left of Grievous Bodily Charm and go left of a large roof, to trend rightwards up the wall to a small groove with an overhang at the top. GRIEVOUS BODILY CHARM E1 5b This starts below one of the few obvious features on the crag. Start below a large triangular roof at about 10m which has a crack running through it (takes Friend 3-3.5). Climb the arête to the roof and step out right into the bottom of a hanging corner on the right hand side of the roof. Here good friend protection can be arranged. Climb into the corner on small holds (crux) and go left up the wall above to the top. An excellent route with the crux being 'only' vertical and on small holds. UNFINISHED SYMPHONY HVS 4c To the right of Grevious Bodily Charm there is a large area of slime running the full height of the cliff, a first ascent is yet to be made. Unfinished Symphony is right of this and climbs between two green slimes - yummy ! The top half is unprotected. Go right up the wall to a right facing corner. SO LONG AND THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH E1 5b This route takes the dry overhanging wall to the left of Bem and to the right of a another slimy area. Fairly high in its grade. Go up left to a large overhang and take it directly. Continue straight up the wall surmounting smaller overhangs. Traverse right at the top to finish as for Bem. Superb climbing. BEM E1 5b A close relation to Bim and Bam, this route takes a series of shallow grooves through an obvious and impressive overhanging mini buttress just left of an area of more continuous slime. With it overhanging possibly 1 in 4 it looks intimidating but the climbing is more amenable than at first sight. Start at the right hand side of the buttress and trend left through a series of grooves to a resting ledge. Go straight up the overhanging groove and finish by trending left near the top, though trending right is also quite feasible. Finishes just right of a fence at the top which is a useful landmark. The crux is possibly near the bottom due to the start being a little slimy. An excellent exposed route on massive holds and low in the grade.

Go straight up the overhanging groove and finish by trending left near the top, though trending right is also quite feasible. Finishes just right of a fence at the top which is a useful landmark. The crux is possibly near the bottom due to the start being a little slimy. An excellent exposed route on massive holds and low in the grade. These two routes are located at the first big inlet and start from just above a platform on the Eastern side. Abseil down to a small ledge 5m above the platform. SWING TIME E3 5c Takes the wall right of BEM where the slime almost runs the full height of the crag. Climb right of the streak on surprisingly dry rock. Steep and strenuous from the start. High on the right is a short green streak. Climb left of this. Good thread runner on the left. Step up and right once past the short green streak and finish on good holds with a massive pump.

Kindred Spirits 20 metres E2 5c Route starts 2 metres left of Codex and at the obvious 'letterbox'. Climb the wall above the letterbox and arrange gear in a rightward trending diagonal crack. Up and left of this diagonal crack there is a foothold. Make hard moves up to gain the foothold and rest. Further difficult moves (crux) and a horizontal break is reached. Easier to top. Breithlá 25 metres VS 4c Route starts 4 metres left of Codex and 2 metre left of obvious 'letterbox'. The route follows a faint crack up to an overlap at 6 metres. Climb the overlap up to an overhang at 10 metres. Climb this on the right and follow crack above to top. Choctaw 170 20 metres E2 5c Route starts in a groove 2 metres left of Breithlá. Climb the groove to the R.H.S. of the overhang. Arrange protection in the horizontal crack above the overhang. Move up with difficulty and get established on the horizontal crack. Continue by a combination of crimps, side pulls and smears (crux) to gain better handholds and then a small ledge and rest. Up slab more easily to top. Bluegrass 25 metres E3 6a Route starts 4 metres left of Breithlá. Climb the blackish groove which trends diagonally left at first and then diagonally back right to a stance below an overlap at 7 metres (first runner). Climb this leftwards to below an overhang. Climb the overhang (hard moves) and get established on small holds (poor rest) at the base of 2 parallel faint cracks (small wire protection). Climb these with increasing difficulty until respite is reached by gaining big T.G. jugs and ledge. Easy to top and block belay. Sligo Sloper 25 metres HVS 5a Route takes arete 2 metres left of Bluegrass. Slope up diagonally leftwards to reach arete. Climb this (crux) to large ledge below short corner. Up easily to top. Black Gold 25 metres E3 6a Route takes the black wall right of Codex. Climb the centre of the wall on large pockets to a horizontal break at 8 metres. Arrange protection and climb the wall by difficult moves, at first on the right, to gain a sloping foothold. Step back left to a small rounded pocket on the wall. Steady oneself and use crimps and side pinches for a few moves to gain a magic jug and gear. Up easily on pockets to top. Carpetbagger 23 metres VS 4b Route takes the first groove right of Black Gold. Climb up to a sloping pulpit and from here climb the groove. Step left near the top onto the arete. Climb easily to top. Ivy Groove 23 metres HS 4a Route takes next groove right of Carpetbagger. Climb to the pulpit and step right into the groove. Up this passing 2 steep sections to top. Crack a-go-go 20 metres VS 4c Route follows curving crack in centre of wall right of Carpetbagger. Start from large ledge. Follow line of crack to ledge below top. Up easily to finish."

Climb the crack to an overhang. Climb this, first on the left and then step back into the crack. Follow to top. Scramble off with care. Western Corridor – 12m (HS) (M.Daly, B.Proctor 4/11/06) This route is behind the pinnacle at the left end of this band of rock, at the highest point. Climb crack past a few ledges.

The crack has three vertical slots that are used for protection and to make upward progress. At top slot, move right and up on small edges (crux) to gain crack leading to top. ===Inishmurray Wall=== The North East side of Hawk Rock has an overhanging wall that is up to 30 metres in height (Inishmurray Wall). The wall overhangs from top to bottom by about 2 metres. There are a number of crack lines in the wall. The descent path to the base of the wall is on the right hand side as you look out from the top of the crag. The descent path is accessed by turning right immediately after exiting from the forest. Follow the track down staying next to the wall until the base is reached (less than 1 minute). There is a final obvious 'step down' at the end of the descent track. The first route starts from this 'step down'. First Blood 20 metres E3 6a (1 rest) Route starts from the bottom of the descent track at the L.H.S. of the wall. From the top of the final step on the descent route, move right into obvious jam crack and climb up to the large ledge above. At the back of this ledge there is an overhang. From the top of the overhang, a crack runs out slightly rightwards, to the top of crag. Arrange gear in horizontal cracks below the large overhang. Pull up strenously into the overhang and place a good number 3 rock above in crack. Continue pulling up and surmount the overhang by hard moves to gain the base of the overhanging crack. Climb strenously up the crack to below the groove. (1 rest taken here). Move up and pull into the groove using a few poor jams. Climb up the groove and gain a jug on the wall on the left. Exit using a small 'spring board' at the top. Stake belays. Rubicon 25metres E3 6a (1 rest) Route starts 5 metres right of First Blood below a groove. The route follows the groove and the overhanging wide crack above. Climb up onto a large pedestal on the right at 2 metres. Step left onto the wall and gain the groove above with difficulty. Follow the groove passing another difficult section to the large ledge at mid-height. Good rest. Move slightly left to the base of the wide overhanging crack. Climb strenuously up the crack to where it widens to an off-width. Climb the off-width (crux) by using small edges on the left wall. Where these small edges run out, an aid point was used here to gain the large hand hold on the right at the top of the off-width. One arm rest possible at this point..

The route climbs the hanging corner just left of Simple Pleasures and continues across the wall in an arching jam crack to join Ferdia. Finish up Ferdia. SIMPLE PLEASURES 24m E1 5b A man-eating offwidth crack. Sustained, strenuous and painful. The route takes the obvious deep overhanging crack on the left side of the crag. Climb the crack to the overhang, move right to a huge flake and layback into a niche. Continue to the top exiting right. HARLEQUIN 24m E4 6a The route takes the obvious line between Simple Pleasures and Ferdia. Ascend the wall passing a bulge just above a good flake and continue up until possible to move leftwards into the curving corner of The Mad Sweeney. Follow this to the point where the undercut traverse starts. Move left through the overlap and continue to the top with less difficulty. FERDIA 28m HVS 5b Airy climbing on an exposed arête. The route takes the flake crack, moves left around the overhang and into the clean-cut corner. Climb flake crack to ledge below overhang at 12 metres. Step up delicately and move left around overhang to corner crack. Climb crack past jammed block to a resting place below a clean-cut overhanging corner. Move up corner for a metre to gain small sharp finger holds on the right wall. Using these traverse across the wall to the arête (crux) and up this to a small stance. Step up and move left, finishing with care. Metal stake belay well back. CLAIOMH 24m E1 5c The Sword. Climb the front of the arête right of Ferdia to the ledge at half height. Move into the corner and climb it directly to the top. ABOVE THE SALT ** 30m E2 5c Start 5 metres right of Ferdia below the prominent white scar which is situated near the top of the crag. Climb a short shallow groove to a horizontal crack, move up and left on pockets to reach a deep jug. Traverse left on jugs to reach a short corner (difficult to enter). Up corner to a ledge on the left. From the large rocking block, traverse right with feet level with the bottom of the block. Make a wide bridge to reach jugs and continue up the wall on pockets to a thin crack on the right side of the white scar (scoop). Move left and climb into the scoop with difficulty. A small jug and side-pull are used to reach the crack and jammed blocks. Climb the crack to reach flat holds and a poor jam (crux). Keep left near the top. Stake belay. To the right of Above The Salt there is a steep clean wall with a flattened bush ( The Burning Bush ) at half-height. THE BURNING BUSH *** 26m E2 5c Strenuous, technical and poorly protected. There are three cracks leading up to the bush. Start at the left one. Climb up to a horizontal break and move right to the centre crack and up to a ledge. Climb to the left around the bush to the base of two parallel cracks. Up the right crack, occasionally using the left one, until forced into the left crack. Climb this (sustained) until hidden jugs over the bulge on the left near the top can be reached. Small block belay. IMITHE LEIS NA CRAOBHACHA ** E1 5c Away with the branches! An excellent crack just right of the bush, leading to some steep wall climbing. Climb the crack below and just right of the bush. Continue up the crack which peters out. Continue up the wall until a jug on the right is reached. Move right to finish. Just to the right of The Burning Bush, a steep crack runs the complete length of the wall (Warthog). WARTHOG ** 27m HVS 5b Delightful crack climbing. Start 2 metres left of a 3 metre triangular pinnacle leaning against the wall. Climb the strenuous crack until possible to bridge onto a flake on the left wall. Continue steeply to good holds at the horizontal break at half-height and rest at a small ledge on the right.

Pull over the bulge and traverse left on a line of jugs to a foothold rest. Move up and right to gain the niche. Turn the base of the niche on the right to reach a crack system. Follow this to its end and then move left across the wall to gain another system which is followed to the top. LAST OF THE SUMMER WINE *** 26m E2 5c A great route which involves difficult bridging, a sensational move over a bulge and a hand ripping crack to finish. This route takes the conspicuous straight crack high up on the wall right of Condor. Start below a shallow corner under the crack. Climb the corner until the crack leads left to a foothold. Climb steeply up to another foothold beneath a sloping ledge. Step right into a short groove and up to a bulge. Climb over this on the right (crux) and gain a small ledge below the crack. Climb the sustained crack to the top. Stake belay. SERPENTS TAIL * 27m E2 5c Start about 4 metres left of Weekend Warrior just left of a right facing corner. Climb the left slanting crack on jugs to an obvious horizontal break. Move left along the break (delicate) to where the steep short crack goes straight up. Follow the crack (crux) until possible to step right onto a slab. Follow the corner of the slab to the steep corner and climb this. Climb more or less directly to the top. Reported to be easier than it looks! WEEKEND WARRIOR ** 30m E1 5c Start at the right hand side of the depression at the detached flake beneath a crack which runs to the top of the crag. Climb up over the flake to a thin crack. Up the crack to an overhanging groove and crack. Climb the groove (crux) with a good flake on the right. Continue up the crack to the top. FINE TIME 30m E4 6a Climbs the crack just right of Weekend Warrior. RAM ROD ** 27m E5 6a Takes the crackline up the wall left of Leda. Follow the sustained crack to a rest below a bulge.

Keeping this ledge at shoulder level traverse left for 2 metres to good ledge and crack. Climb crack to reach good jug on right. A series of jugs lead up right to a bulging wall, from the foot of the wall move up and left to a narrow ramp (crux). Use a sloping hold to reach a deep crack at the back of the ramp. Finish slightly left to top. Stake belay. FERGUS 23m S 4a Start one metre right of Leda. The route takes the obvious corner with the cracked right wall. Climb easily up left to a vegetated ledge. Continue past a small holly tree and climb the corner on good bridging holds and using cracks on right hand wall to reach bulge near the top. Climb the bulge and continue up easier ground to top. Some 10 or 12 metres right of Fergus there is a Landmark Boulder, thirty foot high with a sharply cracked surface. The next batch of routes start in the vicinity of this boulder. MONGOOSE 30m E1 5c Start at or on a large block directly below the finish of Sparrow or Hawk. Climb the thin crack (crux) to good holds and then up to the finish of Sparrow and Hawk.

Start at the base of the flakey crack left of Landmark Boulder. Climb the crack to a huge flake at the start of the diagonal crack. Climb the diagonal crack using good jugs on the lip of the crack to a yellow stain on a steep wall (resting place). Up the wall on jugs and move slightly left at the bulge. Easier climbing to top. MOURNE RAMBLER * 25m HVS 5a An excellent climb which provides technical climbing with protection which must be worked at. Start 1 metre right of Sparrow. Climb the vertical crack, cross Hawk at mid-height, and climb directly over the central bulge on good jugs. Exit left below the top overhang. HAWK ** 33m HVS 5a This route takes the upper diagonal crack. Start opposite the Landmark Boulder. Climb the bulge on flakey jugs to a ledge at the foot of the corner. Traverse left along sloping ledge to reach the start of the diagonal crack. Climb the crack on good jugs (good protection) to the bulge above the yellow stain on Sparrow. Up and left to finish. MAEVE 18m VS 4b Route takes the obvious left facing corner opposite the Landmark Boulder. Start as for Hawk. Climb the bulge on flakey jugs to a small ledge at the foot of the corner. Continue up the corner on good holds to gain the steep part of the corner above. Climb this by thin bridging moves (crux) to the overlap. Move left over the overlap, easier climbing to top. WALL WALKER 30m E2 5c Poor protection and a sustained crux make this a serious lead. Climb the wall right of Mourne Rambler. THE BOULDER 10m VS 4c Climb the steepest right hand side of the Landmark Boulder up a series of cracks. AILLILL 20m VD Climb Maeve to the foot of the steep part of the corner and follow an easier line right and up a series of corners to the top. OCRAS 23m HVS 5a Starvation.

Start right of Landmark Boulder and just left of an obvious flake crack. Climb the groove on good holds. Move slightly left to a small stunted bush. Good holds lead to the right hand end of the ramp and exit via the corner. DEOCH AN UASAIL 18m VS 4b The nobleman's drink. Start immediately right of Teach An Asail. Climb the easy obvious crack moving slightly right to reach a crack at the side of a large left pointing block at about 6 metres. Move left until directly below a short corner near the top of the crag and about 5 metres right of the top of Teach An Asail. Climb the corner, which has a small blunt overhang and exit. To the right of Deoch An Uasail there is an area of poor gullied rock followed by a steep section with it's bulging headwall underlined by a prominent horizontal crack. BACK ROW FROLICS 24m HVS 5a Takes the crack left of Bedroom Boredom. Climb the crack to a good ledge. Move around left and climb the juggy wall. Variation, Direct Finish 24m E3 5c As for Back Row Frolics to the ledge. Follow the corner groove going up and right on to the main face (small wires). Move right and climb the corner up and right. Make a blind move to reach a jug (crux). Continue up the wall above. BEDROOM BOREDOM 27m HVS 5a An enticing line, the steep crack and exciting traverse give good value for 5a. Start below the left hand side of the prominent horizontal crack at the base of two thin vertical cracks. Climb the parallel cracks to a ledge and possible belay at 9 metres. Thinly traverse right using horizontal hand crack. Finish up a steep blocky groove. THE BOLSTER * 24m E2 5c A good route taking the wall right of the double cracks of Bedroom Boredom. Climb easily up ledges to reach a flake. hard climbing leads to a horizontal break above. Follow the diagonal crack to the next break, from the jammed chockstone (good thread) in the break above move up and right to reach a good jug. Continue up the wall to the top. The following two routes are hard to locate (especially without a route description!) and are very scrappy. BILLY'S ROUTE 26m S 4a APRIL FOOL 10m VD Start 3 metres right of Billy's Route directly below a small grass ledge containing several small trees. Climb directly up to the right hand end of the ledge on good holds. Climb the groove above to a steep grass ramp. Move left up the ramp to an obvious roofed chimney. Climb the chimney by bridging and exit on the right. Belay at two metal posts. Well protected but quite loose. ==Lower Tier== Go to the very right hand side of the upper tier. After a small step down a vague path leads around to the bottom of the Lower Tier. After rounding the corner a gully can be seen coming down on the right. This can also be descended from below the Bedroom Boredom Buttress. The ground below falls away steeply to a vertical drop, so belays are recommended at the bottom of the routes. ALPHA 24m HVS 5a About 40 metres left of the descent gully there is a prominent corner leading to overhangs. The route takes the small bulge with a crack, left of the corner, Growling Tortoise. Climb the bulge and crack and continue up the wall on small pockets to reach a good horizontal crack. Move right and climb the crack. Loose rock near the top. PURGATORY * 30m HVS 5b The centre-piece of the lower tier is the huge groove/chimney which leads to the large overhang. Start at the left hand side of the tier above a small ash tree. The route follows the prominent line around the square cut overhang. Climb the deep groove/chimney to the overhang. Traverse rightwards beneath the overhang and layaway around this (crux) to gain a ledge on the wall above. Climb the wall to the top. Thread belay. A magnificent pitch. RECIPIENT MAN ** 35m E2 5c Tremendous climbing with a roof to finish. Good protection. The climb takes the deep crack 4 metres right of the big corner of Purgatory and just in from a big tree. Gain the crack and follow this to a roof (rock is better than it looks!). Climb this using small jugs up on the right. Finish right at the top with care."

Climb the chimney by bridging and exit on the right. Belay at two metal posts. Well protected but quite loose. ==Lower Tier== Go to the very right hand side of the upper tier. After a small step down a vague path leads around to the bottom of the Lower Tier. After rounding the corner a gully can be seen coming down on the right. This can also be descended from below the Bedroom Boredom Buttress. The ground below falls away steeply to a vertical drop, so belays are recommended at the bottom of the routes. ALPHA 24m HVS 5a About 40 metres left of the descent gully there is a prominent corner leading to overhangs. The route takes the small bulge with a crack, left of the corner, Growling Tortoise. Climb the bulge and crack and continue up the wall on small pockets to reach a good horizontal crack. Move right and climb the crack. Loose rock near the top. PURGATORY * 30m HVS 5b The centre-piece of the lower tier is the huge groove/chimney which leads to the large overhang. Start at the left hand side of the tier above a small ash tree. The route follows the prominent line around the square cut overhang. Climb the deep groove/chimney to the overhang. Traverse rightwards beneath the overhang and layaway around this (crux) to gain a ledge on the wall above. Climb the wall to the top. Thread belay. A magnificent pitch. RECIPIENT MAN ** 35m E2 5c Tremendous climbing with a roof to finish. Good protection. The climb takes the deep crack 4 metres right of the big corner of Purgatory and just in from a big tree. Gain the crack and follow this to a roof (rock is better than it looks!). Climb this using small jugs up on the right. Finish right at the top with care."

The following two routes are hard to locate (especially without a route description!) and are very scrappy. BILLY'S ROUTE 26m S 4a APRIL FOOL 10m VD Start 3 metres right of Billy's Route directly below a small grass ledge containing several small trees. Climb directly up to the right hand end of the ledge on good holds. Climb the groove above to a steep grass ramp. Move left up the ramp to an obvious roofed chimney. Climb the chimney by bridging and exit on the right. Belay at two metal posts. Well protected but quite loose. ==Lower Tier== Go to the very right hand side of the upper tier. After a small step down a vague path leads around to the bottom of the Lower Tier. After rounding the corner a gully can be seen coming down on the right. This can also be descended from below the Bedroom Boredom Buttress. The ground below falls away steeply to a vertical drop, so belays are recommended at the bottom of the routes. ALPHA 24m HVS 5a About 40 metres left of the descent gully there is a prominent corner leading to overhangs. The route takes the small bulge with a crack, left of the corner, Growling Tortoise. Climb the bulge and crack and continue up the wall on small pockets to reach a good horizontal crack. Move right and climb the crack. Loose rock near the top. PURGATORY * 30m HVS 5b The centre-piece of the lower tier is the huge groove/chimney which leads to the large overhang. Start at the left hand side of the tier above a small ash tree. The route follows the prominent line around the square cut overhang. Climb the deep groove/chimney to the overhang. Traverse rightwards beneath the overhang and layaway around this (crux) to gain a ledge on the wall above. Climb the wall to the top. Thread belay. A magnificent pitch. RECIPIENT MAN ** 35m E2 5c Tremendous climbing with a roof to finish. Good protection. The climb takes the deep crack 4 metres right of the big corner of Purgatory and just in from a big tree. Gain the crack and follow this to a roof (rock is better than it looks!). Climb this using small jugs up on the right. Finish right at the top with care."

The route follows the prominent line around the square cut overhang. Climb the deep groove/chimney to the overhang. Traverse rightwards beneath the overhang and layaway around this (crux) to gain a ledge on the wall above. Climb the wall to the top. Thread belay. A magnificent pitch. RECIPIENT MAN ** 35m E2 5c Tremendous climbing with a roof to finish. Good protection. The climb takes the deep crack 4 metres right of the big corner of Purgatory and just in from a big tree. Gain the crack and follow this to a roof (rock is better than it looks!). Climb this using small jugs up on the right. Finish right at the top with care."
