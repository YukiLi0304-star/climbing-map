            "description": "P.Hall APPAULING 23m E1 5b This route follows the fluted arête formed by the gully of Illogical Ooze and the large bulging wall to the right. Steep moves lead to a finger crack from where a long reach gains better holds on the right. Continue up more easily to finish through the jungle above. HOWARD'S ROUTE 23m E3/4 6a Start just right of the gully at a short hand crack. Climb the steep crack to reach flake holds. Climb steeply rightwards to reach jugs in the large pocket/hole (crux). Climb directly up the wall above past an old in-situ thread and a short white groove. Finish through the vegetation above. HOWARD'S OTHER ROUTE 23m E5 6a Just to the right of Howard's Route, up a groove past an in-situ peg. Joins The Bounder and finishes as for this route. HOWARD'S THIRD ROUTE 25m E5 6a In the middle of the wall below the long slot on The Bounder traverse.Climb steeply up the wall and finish as for The Bounder. THE BOUNDER 40m E4 6a 1) Follow Monastir Direct to the cave belay at 14 metres. 2) from the belay traverse left for 5m past a good thread to a hard move into a niche with a knee jam rest. Straight up past layaway flake (good nuts) to good jug. Up on finger pocket (crux) to finger jam on the right. Move left to good jug under peg. Make hard move up and left to reach peg. Make a hard move past the peg and right. Make a hard move up the groove and continue more easily to the top. MONASTIR DIRECT 33m HVS 5a Start at the base of the corner rising from the river bed. 1) 14m Bridge up the cave mouth to gain the crack. Strenuous climbing leads to a ledge on the left. Good thread belay just inside the cave (for those with night vision the cave provides an interesting escape!) 2) 19m Follow the wide crack above by bridging to the top of the flake (sparse protection). Continue up the crack above. Belay a long way back. EXPOSE 30m HVS 5a, 4c 1) Climb the first pitch of Monastir Direct to the cave belay. 2) Step down and traverse right on good holds to the bottom of the flake crack. Climb the crack to where the corner steepens. Reach a hidden crack on the right and pull on to a good ledge on the right wall of the corner. Follow the crack and regain the corner near the top. EXPOSE DIRECT START 30m E3 6a This route takes the steep shallow groove and crack just right of the first pitch of Monastir Direct.Climb direct to join the traverse line of Expose level with the cave belay. RIGHTS OF PASSAGE 30m E3 6a Climb Expose Direct Start to where it joins Expose. Climb diagonally rightwards with difficult moves through the overhang. Climb directly up the wall above to finish. ME 36m E2 5b Start in the middle of the wall 10m right of Monastir Direct.Climb the hand jam crack to an arm thread, Hand traverse right to the arête. Up the thin wall to a stance under an overhang.

THE FILTH 30m E1 5b Start at the cave and old tree stump as for Black Bastard.Traverse diagonally right, passing a small overhang on it's right side, to gain a small ledge. From the ledge move straight up then right to a second ledge with an old tree stump. Move a few feet right along the ledge and climb up using a good pocket hold to a thin crack (micro-rocks). From this point move out left on delicate holds and then straight up to tree stump (crux). Pass the small curving overhang above on it's left side using a series of ledges. Trend right towards the top. Passing a small bush on it's right side. THE FEDS 22m E2 5b Start - about 12m right of the cave mentioned in Black Bastard description there is a large triangular-shaped overhang protruding from the rock face.

CAVERNS ABOVE 24m VD At the downstream end of the lower gorge there is a stream issuing from a large hole. Climb the chimney above to a large ledge. Cross this to a small hole in the wall above. Go through and bridge easily up the chasm beyond. Very unusual route. SLIDE SHOW 10m E1 5b At the right-hand end of the crag there is an overhanging white wall. Start at a line of pockets 1m in from the right edge. Climb the pockets and make a difficult reach to a good hold. Continue to a large spike on the left.

From the ledge move straight up then right to a second ledge with an old tree stump. Move a few feet right along the ledge and climb up using a good pocket hold to a thin crack (micro-rocks). From this point move out left on delicate holds and then straight up to tree stump (crux). Pass the small curving overhang above on it's left side using a series of ledges. Trend right towards the top. Passing a small bush on it's right side. THE FEDS 22m E2 5b Start - about 12m right of the cave mentioned in Black Bastard description there is a large triangular-shaped overhang protruding from the rock face. The Feds follows the steep wall and leftward-trending crack just right of the overhang. Start climbing on the steep wall directly below the bottom of the leftward-trending crack. Use a small right-facing corner to gain a ledge on the left. Climb up trending slightly right to a sloping ledge. From the ledge move left to the diagonal crack leading through overhangs. Continue up the crack until it is possible to step left onto a ledge. From here climb straight up and right to finish. A strenuous route. Protection just adequate. JUNGLE BUNNY 10m HVS 5b Route takes the wall 1m left of Keyhole Crack. Climb the wall until possible to reach obvious crack. Move up to a good rest. Continue more easily to the top. KEYHOLE CRACK 9m S 4a Start at the left hand end (upstream end) of the cliff. Move up the obvious wide crack at the left side of the compact wall. Awkward to start. WET DREAM 9m E1 5b Start below the bulge between Keyhole Crack and Brothers In Arms.Straight up to a small spike and sapling (tape runner). Diagonally left to a corner. Up to the top. BROTHERS IN ARMS 12m E3 6a Start 1m right of Wet Dream.Climb up a shallow overhanging groove to reach a finger slot (crux- no protection). Pull up and right on to a block.

Layback up the flake to a tree, then step onto the wall behind this and up a series of jugs to the top. A bit obscure! GOOD SPORT 12m Fr6c+ The line of three bolts in the centre of the compact wall.Fingery and technical to the first bolt. Hard moves past bolt to good holds. Easier above.

VIRGIN RURP 12m E2 5b Start in the middle of the upstream cliff (but on the right hand edge of the cleaner half of the cliff) about 6m left of a large ivy growth and 1 m left of a bulging overhang.Move up a thin crack until possible to step left beneath the brown overhang. Pull over overhang and continue to the top. WHITE OUT 20m HVS 5b Start just left of the arête immediately left of Paddy's Route. Climb the wall to a short crack, gain a good hold and move onto the wall right of the arête. Climb this until possible to traverse left to a ledge and climb overhanging arête to the top. PADDY'S ROUTE 20m S 3c Further right - obvious line at south end of crag.Start on the right and swing left to join right slanting crack. Climb this to strange tube in overhang. Step onto right wall, pull up and continue easily to the top. BLUE MOON 12m D Start in groove below small cave 2m left of Paddy's Route. Climb groove to large platform below overhang. Move left across chimney and finish via yew tree. JUST JUICE 20m VS 4c Start 7m left of Blue Moon where twin grooves form a pillar. Climb left groove for 2m, then move around pillar to right groove and continue up this to top. SNAKE JUICE 23m HVS 5b Start at a large bowl forming overhang 17 m left of Just Juice. Climb corner to a large thread. Awkward move past thread to top of crack. Climb wall above using holds on the left (crux). Belay at tree and walk right along the ledge to the top. CAVERNS ABOVE 24m VD At the downstream end of the lower gorge there is a stream issuing from a large hole. Climb the chimney above to a large ledge. Cross this to a small hole in the wall above. Go through and bridge easily up the chasm beyond. Very unusual route. SLIDE SHOW 10m E1 5b At the right-hand end of the crag there is an overhanging white wall. Start at a line of pockets 1m in from the right edge. Climb the pockets and make a difficult reach to a good hold. Continue to a large spike on the left. Step right and continue to the top. 400px|REVIVAL & PADDY'S SWING REVIVAL & PADDY'S SWING 400px|PADDY'S SWING - MIKE'S ROUTE PADDY'S SWING - MIKE'S ROUTE 400px|MIKE'S ROUTE - ILLOGICAL OOZE MIKE'S ROUTE - ILLOGICAL OOZE 400px|ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS/ILLOGICAL OOZE Gully ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS/ILLOGICAL OOZE Gully 400px|APPAULING - MONASTIR DIRECT MONASTIR DIRECT 400px|MONASTIR DIRECT - Left-handside of the large flake in the middle of the picture.
