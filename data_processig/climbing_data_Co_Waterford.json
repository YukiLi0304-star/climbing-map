            "description": "Move across left from the belay and go up on good holds to follow a crack leading up left to a wide ledge below a large, light-coloured patch (possible belay). >From the right end of the ledge follow a ramp up left around the corner to the edge of a wide gully. Step back right onto a rib and climb to the fence. Chúl na Gaoithe S Climb straight up from the belay to the foot of the crack running up left towards a short corner. Follow the crack, then move up direct to belay on the ledge system below the grass. Escape by an easy traverse right along the ledge system. Díseart S Climb diagonally right from the belay to reach the cracks near the edge of the slab and move up over these to belay on the ledge system. Escape by traversing off right. The starting point for the next two climbs is gained by abseiling beneath the two arches to the foot of the narrow gully. Underneath the Arches VD Start on a flat boulder at the foot of the gully, or a higher ledge if this is under water. Climb diagonally left on good holds to gain the arete, which is followed to the top. Underneath the Arches VD. Arch gully VD Start as for Underneath the Arches. Climb the gully. The next batch of climbs are reached by scrambling out beyond the arch to the tip of the arete and backclimbing down an easy slab on the N side to reach a large tidal platform which contains a small pool. Wysiwyg S Move around to the left to a wide ledge below the crack that splits the short south-facing wall. Climb the crack. Arete Groove VD Start 4m right of Wysiwyg below the groove at the end of the arete. Climb the groove. Groove & flake D Start just right of the descent route, near the left edge of the pool, below and left of the black groove containing a large flake. Move up right to the foot of the flake, then up the groove. Black arete VD Start 3m right of Groove and Flake at the back of the pool. Climb a short, steep staircase, and step out right to follow the arete. Seal VD Start 2m right of Black Arete at the right end of the pool. Up steeply to a bulge, which is climbed on good holds. Soft Day S Start about 8m right of Seal, to the right of a wide, shallow corner with a light patch, and 2m left of a narrow gully, below a short wall and small overhang. Climb the overhang direct. Greasy Gully VD This route follows the narrow chimney above a small inlet. The chimney is unprotected, usually greasy and not recommended. Starfish D Start 2m right of the chimney, below the left edge of the slab. Climb the edge to a block belay. ==Carraig na néan== The next headland to the South. Routes from D to VS4b, all tidal. Approach. Continue along the cliff path and leave it at a concrete stile. Go back inside the fence, passing above a zawn, then, keeping close to a drop on the right, go down to the tip of the headland and locate the top of an easy-angled slab (The Slipway) that slopes to the south. The top of The Slipway is almost directly above a small rock island. A block near the top of The Slipway makes a good abseil point for the following routes. (Note - There are large unclimbed slabs immediately south of the zawn mentioned above, but the tops of these are heavily vegetated.) Easna Éasca VD Half to low tide only. Either scramble or abseil down The Slipway (there is a short steep section near the bottom) and belay in a groove. Move across right and down to a ledge. From the right hand end of the ledge move up and left to a higher ledge. Step right onto face of obvious yellow wall. Exposed climbing to reach The Slipway, just below the steep corner that provides the next route. Cúinne geal an lae HS 4b This climb takes the steep corner half-way down The Slipway, about 8m below the abseil block. The top of the corner is split in two by a large block. Climb the left side of the corner until it steepens. Move across right and struggle up the deep crack (crux). Fruit Bat HS 4b. Start as for above. Climb the right side of the corner for 3m and pull across right to gain the foot of the narrow slab sloping up right beneath the overhanging wall. Climb to the top of the slab and make a difficult exit onto a ledge, below a slanting corner. Move up and pull out left onto a rib which is followed to the top. Humus Delight D Start as for above. Move across right and climb the obvious right trending groove. Move back left beneath the headwall to finish just above the abseil block. Pluto's Chute D Start 3 m right of above. Climb the right slanting groove. Move back left at the top to finish as for Hummus Delight. The next four climbs are on the main slab, which lies about 12m north of The Slipway. The foot of the slab can be reached by traversing right from Pluto's Chute (low tide only) or by abseiling from a stake in a grassy patch above the slab. The stake is directly above the low rock-ridge running out from the foot of the cliff. Amadu S Start at the bottom left of the main slab, below a right facing corner. Climb the corner to the top of a block at the foot of the crack running up the left edge of the slab. Finish up the crack. Le Main Au Kratin VS 4b B. March G. Moss 8/4/00 Start just right of above, below a short crack. Follow thin crack to where it peters out and step right to stance. Move up on small solution pockets, trending left until back on original line again. Sparse protection. Seamus's Route HS 4b S. Crowley S. Daly 8/4/00 The crack-line 3m right of Le Main au Kratin. Protection is widely spaced. Codladh Sámh HS 4a Start at the bottom right of the slab, at the foot of an easy-angled crack that slopes up right to a shoulder. Climb the crack to the shoulder. Climb the corner at the right edge of the slab to a square-cut overhang, step right and continue to a ledge with a small cave. Climb left over grass and rock to belay stake. ==Samson Rocks== The area to the N of the wreck of the crane-ship 'Samson'. Map M1, M2. Approach. From the concrete stile mentioned above continue along the S.D.W. for about 50m, until directly above a small rocky island (see map). Go down towards this on a faint path. Scramble down to a quartz-streaked block directly above the island and abseil from the block. The next two climbs start from a small ledge on the high-water mark, below the block. Short Back & Sides VS 4c G. Moss B. March 8/4/00 Climb slightly left and up through steep rock to gain a short slab leading to the abseil block. Poorly protected. Samson's Downfall HVS 5a B. March G. Moss 8/4/00 A well protected test piece. Start as for Short Back and Sides. Move up into X-shaped formation and muscle up left through overhang on good holds. Follow crack until a step left can be made to join top of Short Back and Sides. Conjob HS S. Daly C. Murray 8/4/00 This climb is located on the S side of the zawn immediately S of the above two climbs. Scramble carefully down the N side of the zawn and cross the large block to the S side. Go down left to a ledge below and left of the right facing corner. Climb up and right to enter the corner, which is followed to the top. The cliffs behind and immediately south of the wreck are heavily vegetated and uninviting. Ram Head is situated at the point where the orientation of the cliffs change from east-facing to south-facing. The northern section of the head is too sheltered and is of little interest, but there are steep cliffs on the southern and south-eastern parts of the head which should be worth a closer look. ==Carraig na Rón== Map M1, M2, M3 The headland bounded by Coolabeg zawn to the east and Baunafoilwee to the west. Routes from V. D to VS4b, all tidal. Approach. Leave the cliff path about 70m west of the small concrete look-out post, at a section of double fencing, and descend along a little path, with Coolabeg zawn on the left (east) at first, to the tip of the headland. Scramble down to a long, wide ledge split by a narrow gully. Back-climb or abseil down the gully to a ledge system on the high-water mark. The first 3 climbs are to the left of the gully. Step we gaily HS 4a Traverse left (west) for 5m to the end of the ledge, scramble down and continue traversing left below two corners. Step across a narrow inlet onto a large sloping platform. Climb the short, steep, west facing wall near the head of the inlet and right of the foot of the deep corner, to gain a ramp sloping up R. Follow this, with one awkward step and go around a rib (good thread runner) before moving up to finish. Note - The deep corner mentioned above has been looked at, but it is very friable at the top and not recommended. Flanagan's off to Cham. VS 4b. The corner 5m left of the gully. From the left end of the ledge scramble down and left to the foot of the corner. Climb to the bulge, move right then back left and up the corner. Carraig na Rón VD The steep left edge of the descent gully. The following climbs are all to the right of the descent gully. Stalked by a Seal S The crack 1m right of the gully.

The top of The Slipway is almost directly above a small rock island. A block near the top of The Slipway makes a good abseil point for the following routes. (Note - There are large unclimbed slabs immediately south of the zawn mentioned above, but the tops of these are heavily vegetated.) Easna Éasca VD Half to low tide only. Either scramble or abseil down The Slipway (there is a short steep section near the bottom) and belay in a groove. Move across right and down to a ledge.

Approach - A little over 100m west of Fr. O'Donnell's Well the St. Declan's Way turns sharply inland (this point can be reached from the carpark at the football pitch in less than two minutes). Leave the Way at this point; go down a path of sorts, following the fence down and around to the second right-angled corner (about 150 meters). Go down sharp left just before a junction with a low bank, following a faint path, to the obvious level grassy area with a sharp drop on its west side. This is Basecamp. Drohideen (Map M4). This buttress lies just east of the Tea Flag. Approach. Climb a short step at the back of the Tea Flag and traverse east above a deep corner (the line of Chul na Greine). Scramble down in the direction of a small, circular rock island, to reach a dark ledge on the high-water mark (Note - the deep gully above the rock island has been looked at, but the rock is very poor on the upper section). Chúl na Gréine VS 4c Traverse back west to the end of the ledge. Step down and make a few moves of about Diff., to enter the deep corner on the left. Start from a belay on the large boulders. Climb the crack on the left at the back of the corner to a gap. A difficult move regains the crack, which is followed steeply to where a short, subsidiary crack goes diagonally right. Hand traverse out along this and continue up the narrow chimney. Well protected. (Note - On the first ascent the diagonal crack was followed because the direct finish up the corner was too wet to climb. When dry, the direct would be the logical and better finish, at a grade or two higher). Chúl na Gréine Steeped in Crack HVS 5a Start in the deep corner, as for Chúl na Gréine, below the wide crack on the right side of the corner. Climb the crack over a bulge and continue to the top (good sling at mid-height). Sea Otter HVS 5a Start 2m right of the deep corner, 4m left of the left end of the ledge, below two small overhangs. Climb up over first overhang into a short corner (good brass wire). Climb the second overhang (crux, 2 1/2 friend) and another short corner above to large holds in scoop (sling). Move up shallow right facing corner and wall above to top. A Bristol Lass S Start below a left-facing corner, which is directly above the left end of the ledge. Climb the corner. Rock of Ages VS 4c Start on the ledge, 3m right of A Bristol Lass. Climb easily to the overlap, over this steeply on small holds and move a little right to finish. Poorly protected. Bright November D The shallow right-facing groove 3m right of above. Tea Flag Buttress. (Map m4). The buttress directly below the E side of Basecamp. Approach. From a block or the stake at the E end of the level grassy area abseil down a series of short corners to a wide ledge 3m above high water mark. Written in Stone VS 4b Traverse left (west) along a narrow ledge (D.), to reach the foot of the deep, overhanging corner crack that demarcates the left edge of the buttress. Climb the corner direct. The Mason's Apron HS Start at the right end of the narrow ledge, on a wide platform. Traverse along the ledge until below a corner with an obvious jammed block in the upper section. Move up to the foot of the corner and step out left onto a sloping ledge. Traverse airily left across the slab, climb a short crack and finish pleasantly up the right-trending corner. Guys the Limit S Start as for above. Climb the corner, taking the jammed block on it's left. December Blue D Start on the broad platform, as for above. The route follows, more or less, the line of the abseil. Pool Corner S Start about 4m. around to the right from December Blue, below the corner at the left end of the wall. This wall overlooks a large platform with a pool at its centre. Climb the thin crack in the corner and continue over ledges to the abseil block. Pool Corner Big High VS 4c This route takes the thin crack one meter R of the corner crack of Pool Corner. Bang E1 5b Start 2m right of Pool Corner, just left of a roof at head height. Climb the thin crack that runs up the left-hand side of the roof to a ledge at 4m. Climb the corner above to the top. Astralasia HVS 5a Start below the first corner to the right of Bang. Climb the thin crack to a small roof. Move right at the roof to a small ledge. Step up left into the groove and up to the top. By Memory Inspired HS 4a Start beneath the obvious corner immediately right of the rock fall area. Climb the corner on good holds, moving left when above the quartzite projections, then back slightly right to belay on a good ledge, in a corner just below the top. By Memory Inspired HS 4a After the Rain HVS 5a Start beneath the next corner to the right. Climb the corner and go up right of the block. Gain the top of the block and go up diagonally left. Climb the corner above onto slab. Step left for belay on large ledge. N.B. The corner above the slab is loose and broken. Two for Tea VS4c Start at the extreme righthand end of the pool platform, on the left edge of a narrow zawn. Climb diagonally left into the corner and move up to where a narrow, vegetated crack system slopes up right. Follow this delicately to exit on the platform above. An Lúidín. (Map M1, M4, M5). The little finger of rock forming a promontory (shown clearly on the map) just west of Basecamp. It is separated from Basecamp Wall by a deep wide crack, bridged by a chockstone. The S facing wall is a suntrap and offers excellent climbing on sound rock, while there are some easier routes on the inland side. Approach. From Basecamp scramble down over easy rock to the west (right facing out) of the narrow corner of Written in Stone and move around west to the chockstone. Step across the crack and move along the crest to the large boss at the west end. The foot of the climbs on either side can be reached by abseiling from here. The first three routes are non-tidal and are on the inland (north) side, overlooking Cuaisin Caol. Doyle's Corner S Abseil down the crack on the north side to a stance just above the high-water mark. Climb steeply leftwards over a bulge to reach easier ground. Cuaisín Crack VD Start as for Doyles Corner. Climb the crack to the boss. Lone Sea Breakers S Start as for above. Climb diagonally right for 6m then move straight up to finish on the boss. The following climbs are all on the south-facing side of An Luidin and are accessed by abseiling down the face, following the line of the deep crack below the boss, or by back-climbing from the boss at about v.diff. Daly Bred S Abseil to the foot of the crack on the south face. Start 3m left of the crack below a ledge at a little over 2m. Gain the ledge and climb the wall near its right edge. Guys & Dolls VS 4c Climb the deep crack, which is steep and juggy. Blind Man HVS 5a Note - A storm has removed the nose mentioned on this route but it does not seem to have altered the grade. Start 2m right of Guys and Dolls and just left of a prominent triangular overhang with a flake crack on its left Climb steeply to a sloping ledge just right of a short nose. Move left around the nose and mantle the pulpit (crux). Step right and follow a groove running from right to left below a higher overhang. Climb directly to the top. Protection adequate. Plain Sailing HS 4b As for Blind Man as far as the sloping ledge. Move up and right to gain the foot of the flake crack. Follow this to the top. Cloudburst E1 5b Start immediately right of Plain Sailing, below a line of ledges. Climb directly up these until a large round hold can be reached (possible wire & friend). From here good holds can be reached up on the right. Reachy moves on good holds lead to good wires and the top. Water Slide VS 4b Start at the right end of this section of the S facing wall, 2m left of the left facing corner. Follow the groove from left to right . Poor Protection. Murphy's Lá VD Start right of Water Slide in a corner. Climb the corner, trending right to the foot of a higher corner capped by an overhang. Climb the right wall of this corner and move out right to finish. The next two climbs start about 12m to the right of Murphy's L?, at the right-hand end of the south facing wall. The most convenient approach to the foot of these two climbs is by abseil, down the crack below the chockstone. Pink Panther VD Start 2m left of January Sun in the right facing corner. Up the corner and over ledges to the foot of a flake crack. Climb this. January Sun S Start at the extreme right of the platform, at the bottom left of the wide crack with the chockstone. Follow the left edge of the crack. Condor. S Hop across the channel to the right edge of the wide crack below the chockstone. Climb the edge. ==Cuaisín Caol Wall== (Map M5). This is the wall facing the north side of An Lúidín, from across the narrow cove of Cuasin Caol. The left-hand section of the wall is topped by a series of platforms, or wide ledges, many of which are littered with debris, while the right-hand end has a pair of fine corners, before petering out in a steep, narrow, boulder filled gully. Just opposite the tip of An Lúidín, there is a platform with some debris on its west side and a block sitting near the edge. An abseil stake has been put in place above this, between the embankment and the edge of the cliff. Abseil down onto the platform. Two pitons have been left insitu on the platform, from which a further abseil can be made (satisfy yourself that they are ok before using them) to a large sloping ledge about 6m above high water mark. The first two climbs start from here. (An alternative approach to these two climbs is to do the first pitch of Stampede). Note - the first three climbs finish up through an area with a lot of loose debris lying on ledges and great care is needed to avoid any stonefall Beetember HS 4a A fine start leads to a loose finish. Start from the large ledge, directly below the abseil point, just right of a step at the foot of a right facing corner. Climb the corner and continue over a slight bulge to reach a long ledge near its left end, below the wall with the quartz patches. Move a little right and carefully climb the wall to the abseil platform. Scramble carefully off. Caol Uisce HS 4b A fine start leads to a loose finish. Start at the foot of a long, right facing corner, reached by an airy step around from the right end of the large sloping ledge mentioned above. Climb the corner on good holds and trend carefully up left over two ledges to reach the platform with the pegs. Scramble carefully off. Stampede HS 4a Easy climbing leads to a loose finish. Low to half tide. Approach from Basecamp scramble down over easy rock and move west to the chockstone bridging the crack. Scramble down the edge of the slab to the boulders at the water's edge. Start just above and right of a huge red boulder, on a large, flat boulder below a wide crack. The crack runs up to the right end of a long ramp sloping up left. 1. VD Steep moves on big holds lead to easier climbing and the foot of the ramp. Follow this easily to a block belay 2m right of the first of two right facing corners. Pitch 2. 4a. Climb the corner, passing a steep section (crux), and step left at the jammed block. Move carefully left and climb a series of steps, trending left to reach the platform with the peg belays. Scramble off from here. Slí na Sláinte HVS 5a Protection is adequate and the interest is continuous. Start as for Stampede. Pitch 1, 5a. Climb the crack to where the angle eases just below the overhang. Traverse right on a footledge for 2m and pull over the bulge. Climb the left-trending crack to the top of the block and the steep corner above it. Several mantelshelves, one of which is difficult, lead to the foot of a second steep corner. Climb this to a wide, sloping, grassy ledge and move up to a sling and nut belay on a large flake. Pitch 2, VD Traverse right for 4m, step across right and climb the top of Sliabh Geal gCua to a metal spike belay just below the bank. Sliabh Geal gCua VS 4c Easier than it looks. Half-tide. Start 2m right of above, below the obvious long corner line. An overhanging start on good holds leads to some mantelshelves and a short, thin section, which is difficult to protect, before gaining the crack in the upper section. Straightforward lay-backing and bridging lead to a good incut ledge and the end of the difficulties. Continue easily up the corner and scramble up a short grassy section to a metal belay stake. (On the first ascent a peg was placed just above the incut ledge, with the intention of abseiling off, to avoid loose blocks above. The peg was too poor to be trusted, however, so an escape left was made. This upper section, which goes at about v. diff., was subsequently cleaned and climbed) Pinnacle Crack HS The pinnacle blocking the boulder filled gully to the right of Sliabh Geal gCua. It has a deep chimney on its right and two shorter corner cracks on its face. Start below the right facing corner crack on the face. Climb the corner to a spike belay, just below the top of the pinnacle. Abseil off (long sling needed). ==Basecampwall== Map M5. The slightly overhanging wall directly below the west side of Basecamp. A low arch, running east-west, pierces it. From Basecamp scramble down seaward on easy rock and move west to cross the narrow cleft onto An Lúidín just above a large chockstone. Move down the slab to the mouth of the arch for the next route. Stairway to Paradise HS 4b Start at the right side of the arch, at the foot of the obvious stepped ramp running up left. Follow the ramp to the top. Care needed with the rock April Airs VS 4b Start 4m right of Stairway to Paradise, below a slanting crack that starts 3m up the wall and runs up to a shoulder. Climb steeply to the crack, follow this to the shoulder and climb the short wall above. ==The Capstone== Map M6. It is worthwhile dropping down to Basecamp to get a fix on the position of the Capstone before approaching it. Cuasín Caol. A = Capstone. B = Beetember. C = Doyle's Corner. To reach the Capstone from Basecamp, return to the bank junction and continue west along the bank for about 45m, until directly above a large platform with a boulder sitting at its centre. Scramble down carefully (or abseil) to the platform and abseil from the boulder, directly to the Capstone for the Left Wall, or down the corner for the Right Wall. Capstone Left Wall. This is the first section of the Capstone area and is reached by scrambling down left (west) from the Capstone to gain the top of the ramp that runs down across the wall. Continue down to the foot of the ramp (one awkward section) and move up to reach a wide platform just right of Foilbeg, the zawn that marks the left or west edge of this area. The wall looks impressive but, on the central section, the quality deteriorates with height. West End Wall S Start 3m right of the edge. Follow a line, more or less direct, to the platform on top. (N.B. If tidal conditions rule out the traverse across from the Capstone, it is possible to abseil from this platform to the foot of the climb). Corn Flakes VS 4b From the right -hand end of the ramp, move 10m(?) left and climb an overhang which leads to a corner running from right to left. Good rock and good protection at the bottom of the corner leads to poor rock and poor protection above. Red Rocks HS Start near the top of the ramp, below and right of an obvious crack in the short, red headwall. Up steeply on good holds (no protection) to the foot of a slab. Gain the slab via a high step, move up and mantelshelf onto a ledge below the crack in the wall. Climb this or the shallow corner on the right. Capstone Lower Buttress. The next three routes are on the buttress directly below the Capstone and are reached by abseiling from the left (west) side of the Capstone down a corner to a barnacle-covered ledge just below the high water mark. Capstone Crack VD Climb the corner to the Capstone and continue to the platform above. Capstone left Corner VD Start about 3m right of Capstone Crack, below a short left facing corner with a crack. Climb the corner to a sloping ledge below a second corner. Steeply up this to the Capstone. Capstone right corner VD Start 2m right of Capstone Left Corner, below a short right facing corner. Climb the corner, move right and up to the Capstone. Capstone Right Wall Map M6. This wall is protected from westerly winds and, as a result, is often climbable when other areas are waveswept. The climbs are reached by abseiling down the corner to the east of the block on the platform or by scrambling down right (east) from The Capstone to the foot of the slab. Odhrán HVS 5a Start below the overhang at the foot of the slab and just right of a shallow cave. Climb the overhang for 4m, move right to good handhold and pull up on increasingly good holds to a large ledge. Move left and finish up the obvious corner. Cú Uladh S Start at the left end of the ledge system, on a ledge on the high-water mark, or a higher ledge if the tide is in, below a short, narrow corner, formed by a flake, near the top of the crag. Climb up and enter the corner which leads to the platform, just right of Odhrán. The Music Makers S Start 3m right of Cú Uladh, below and just right of the right-facing open-book corner. Climb, trending left, to the foot of the corner. Follow the left edge of the slab in an airy position. A little help from my friends HVS 5a A poorly protected finish. Start as for Music Makers, below and left of protruding V-shaped block. Climb left-hand side of block to large ledge and clean left facing corner. Climb the corner (crux)to reach the right hand end of the large platform. Sacralicious HVS 5a Start just right of A little Help From My Friends. Climb a corner to a large ledge. Step left and climb the right side of the large protruding block. From the top of the block move right to a small ledge then up and back left to finish. Small friends for protection. Dúlamán VS 5a Start to the right of Sacralicious, below a short corner. Climb the corner to the large sloping ledge. Make a difficult move to gain the small ledge below a crack sloping up left. Climb the crack to a stake belay. Well protected. Tracy VS4c Start below the right end of the wide sloping ledge, behind the squat sea stack (Tuar). Climb to the sloping ledge. Move 2m left to a small niche. Up and back right on small holds to finish on a ledge (avoid loose rock slightly to left of top section). add comment The headland between Foilbeg and Foilmore has some steep rock, but there appears to be a horizontal band of bad rock running across the upper section. ==Foilnadilisk Head== Map M1, M7. This area is demarcated on the left (west), by a narrow zawn, Foilnadilisk and on the right (east), by a smaller zawn, Foileen. Approach. As for Basecamp as far as the junction of the earthen banks. Move up along the bank and follow a higher bank and fence west above the cliffs for a further 150m, passing two zawns to reach the headland between Foileen and Foilnadilisk. Scramble down over rough, steep ground to a wide ledge with a pile of blocks. Abseil from the blocks to the foot of the wall. From the base of the wall move west for about 150m, scramble around back of small zawn, then down to platform at sea level (a small inlet bisects this). The crag is on the left, an obvious clean face, while the arete is immediately to the right, practically at the end of the inlet. All the climbs are short, but worthwhile Beta Blockers HS Start below a strange block formation near the left end of the wall. Climb up through the blocks to top. Fault Line VS 4b Start 2m right of above. Climb the obvious line. Large Triangle. VS 4b. Start 2m right of above. Climb through large triangular niche to top. Foilin In Love Again VS 4c Start 3m right of Large Triangle. Climb thin parallel cracks through small triangular niche and with difficulty gain large jug in popcorn crack. Continue to top. Blasphemiss HS 4b Start at the foot of the obvious left slanting chimney/groove at the head of the inlet. Struggle up this as best you can. Rob HVS 5a Start a little right of Blasphemiss, on flat slab below point of nose. Move up to ledge under overhang, veer left and straight up. Foiled Again HS Start just right of Rob, below the short pod. Dicult moves to enter the pod are followed by easier climbing. The following three climbs are located on the wall below the abseil blocks. Little Jack HS Start just left of the blocks below a faint crack. Climb the crack. Only Up. HS Start 2m right of Little Jack, below obvious crack, which is followed to the top. Dun Coffin VS 4c Start 3m right of Only Up. Follow flaked crack straight to top."

This is the wall facing the north side of An Lúidín, from across the narrow cove of Cuasin Caol. The left-hand section of the wall is topped by a series of platforms, or wide ledges, many of which are littered with debris, while the right-hand end has a pair of fine corners, before petering out in a steep, narrow, boulder filled gully. Just opposite the tip of An Lúidín, there is a platform with some debris on its west side and a block sitting near the edge. An abseil stake has been put in place above this, between the embankment and the edge of the cliff. Abseil down onto the platform. Two pitons have been left insitu on the platform, from which a further abseil can be made (satisfy yourself that they are ok before using them) to a large sloping ledge about 6m above high water mark. The first two climbs start from here. (An alternative approach to these two climbs is to do the first pitch of Stampede). Note - the first three climbs finish up through an area with a lot of loose debris lying on ledges and great care is needed to avoid any stonefall Beetember HS 4a A fine start leads to a loose finish. Start from the large ledge, directly below the abseil point, just right of a step at the foot of a right facing corner. Climb the corner and continue over a slight bulge to reach a long ledge near its left end, below the wall with the quartz patches. Move a little right and carefully climb the wall to the abseil platform. Scramble carefully off. Caol Uisce HS 4b A fine start leads to a loose finish. Start at the foot of a long, right facing corner, reached by an airy step around from the right end of the large sloping ledge mentioned above. Climb the corner on good holds and trend carefully up left over two ledges to reach the platform with the pegs. Scramble carefully off. Stampede HS 4a Easy climbing leads to a loose finish. Low to half tide. Approach from Basecamp scramble down over easy rock and move west to the chockstone bridging the crack. Scramble down the edge of the slab to the boulders at the water's edge. Start just above and right of a huge red boulder, on a large, flat boulder below a wide crack. The crack runs up to the right end of a long ramp sloping up left. 1. VD Steep moves on big holds lead to easier climbing and the foot of the ramp. Follow this easily to a block belay 2m right of the first of two right facing corners. Pitch 2. 4a. Climb the corner, passing a steep section (crux), and step left at the jammed block. Move carefully left and climb a series of steps, trending left to reach the platform with the peg belays. Scramble off from here. Slí na Sláinte HVS 5a Protection is adequate and the interest is continuous. Start as for Stampede. Pitch 1, 5a. Climb the crack to where the angle eases just below the overhang. Traverse right on a footledge for 2m and pull over the bulge. Climb the left-trending crack to the top of the block and the steep corner above it. Several mantelshelves, one of which is difficult, lead to the foot of a second steep corner. Climb this to a wide, sloping, grassy ledge and move up to a sling and nut belay on a large flake. Pitch 2, VD Traverse right for 4m, step across right and climb the top of Sliabh Geal gCua to a metal spike belay just below the bank. Sliabh Geal gCua VS 4c Easier than it looks. Half-tide. Start 2m right of above, below the obvious long corner line. An overhanging start on good holds leads to some mantelshelves and a short, thin section, which is difficult to protect, before gaining the crack in the upper section. Straightforward lay-backing and bridging lead to a good incut ledge and the end of the difficulties. Continue easily up the corner and scramble up a short grassy section to a metal belay stake. (On the first ascent a peg was placed just above the incut ledge, with the intention of abseiling off, to avoid loose blocks above. The peg was too poor to be trusted, however, so an escape left was made. This upper section, which goes at about v. diff., was subsequently cleaned and climbed) Pinnacle Crack HS The pinnacle blocking the boulder filled gully to the right of Sliabh Geal gCua. It has a deep chimney on its right and two shorter corner cracks on its face. Start below the right facing corner crack on the face. Climb the corner to a spike belay, just below the top of the pinnacle. Abseil off (long sling needed). ==Basecampwall== Map M5. The slightly overhanging wall directly below the west side of Basecamp.

Climb steeply to the crack, follow this to the shoulder and climb the short wall above. ==The Capstone== Map M6. It is worthwhile dropping down to Basecamp to get a fix on the position of the Capstone before approaching it. Cuasín Caol. A = Capstone. B = Beetember. C = Doyle's Corner. To reach the Capstone from Basecamp, return to the bank junction and continue west along the bank for about 45m, until directly above a large platform with a boulder sitting at its centre. Scramble down carefully (or abseil) to the platform and abseil from the boulder, directly to the Capstone for the Left Wall, or down the corner for the Right Wall. Capstone Left Wall. This is the first section of the Capstone area and is reached by scrambling down left (west) from the Capstone to gain the top of the ramp that runs down across the wall. Continue down to the foot of the ramp (one awkward section) and move up to reach a wide platform just right of Foilbeg, the zawn that marks the left or west edge of this area. The wall looks impressive but, on the central section, the quality deteriorates with height. West End Wall S Start 3m right of the edge. Follow a line, more or less direct, to the platform on top. (N.B. If tidal conditions rule out the traverse across from the Capstone, it is possible to abseil from this platform to the foot of the climb). Corn Flakes VS 4b From the right -hand end of the ramp, move 10m(?) left and climb an overhang which leads to a corner running from right to left. Good rock and good protection at the bottom of the corner leads to poor rock and poor protection above. Red Rocks HS Start near the top of the ramp, below and right of an obvious crack in the short, red headwall. Up steeply on good holds (no protection) to the foot of a slab. Gain the slab via a high step, move up and mantelshelf onto a ledge below the crack in the wall. Climb this or the shallow corner on the right. Capstone Lower Buttress.

Straightforward lay-backing and bridging lead to a good incut ledge and the end of the difficulties. Continue easily up the corner and scramble up a short grassy section to a metal belay stake. (On the first ascent a peg was placed just above the incut ledge, with the intention of abseiling off, to avoid loose blocks above. The peg was too poor to be trusted, however, so an escape left was made. This upper section, which goes at about v. diff., was subsequently cleaned and climbed) Pinnacle Crack HS The pinnacle blocking the boulder filled gully to the right of Sliabh Geal gCua. It has a deep chimney on its right and two shorter corner cracks on its face. Start below the right facing corner crack on the face. Climb the corner to a spike belay, just below the top of the pinnacle. Abseil off (long sling needed). ==Basecampwall== Map M5. The slightly overhanging wall directly below the west side of Basecamp.

This is the first section of the Capstone area and is reached by scrambling down left (west) from the Capstone to gain the top of the ramp that runs down across the wall. Continue down to the foot of the ramp (one awkward section) and move up to reach a wide platform just right of Foilbeg, the zawn that marks the left or west edge of this area. The wall looks impressive but, on the central section, the quality deteriorates with height. West End Wall S Start 3m right of the edge. Follow a line, more or less direct, to the platform on top. (N.B. If tidal conditions rule out the traverse across from the Capstone, it is possible to abseil from this platform to the foot of the climb). Corn Flakes VS 4b From the right -hand end of the ramp, move 10m(?) left and climb an overhang which leads to a corner running from right to left. Good rock and good protection at the bottom of the corner leads to poor rock and poor protection above. Red Rocks HS Start near the top of the ramp, below and right of an obvious crack in the short, red headwall. Up steeply on good holds (no protection) to the foot of a slab. Gain the slab via a high step, move up and mantelshelf onto a ledge below the crack in the wall. Climb this or the shallow corner on the right. Capstone Lower Buttress.

Climb the crack on the left at the back of the corner to a gap. A difficult move regains the crack, which is followed steeply to where a short, subsidiary crack goes diagonally right. Hand traverse out along this and continue up the narrow chimney. Well protected. (Note - On the first ascent the diagonal crack was followed because the direct finish up the corner was too wet to climb. When dry, the direct would be the logical and better finish, at a grade or two higher). Chúl na Gréine Steeped in Crack HVS 5a Start in the deep corner, as for Chúl na Gréine, below the wide crack on the right side of the corner. Climb the crack over a bulge and continue to the top (good sling at mid-height). Sea Otter HVS 5a Start 2m right of the deep corner, 4m left of the left end of the ledge, below two small overhangs.

Climb the crack on the left at the back of the corner to a gap. A difficult move regains the crack, which is followed steeply to where a short, subsidiary crack goes diagonally right. Hand traverse out along this and continue up the narrow chimney. Well protected. (Note - On the first ascent the diagonal crack was followed because the direct finish up the corner was too wet to climb. When dry, the direct would be the logical and better finish, at a grade or two higher). Chúl na Gréine Steeped in Crack HVS 5a Start in the deep corner, as for Chúl na Gréine, below the wide crack on the right side of the corner. Climb the crack over a bulge and continue to the top (good sling at mid-height). Sea Otter HVS 5a Start 2m right of the deep corner, 4m left of the left end of the ledge, below two small overhangs. Climb up over first overhang into a short corner (good brass wire). Climb the second overhang (crux, 2 1/2 friend) and another short corner above to large holds in scoop (sling). Move up shallow right facing corner and wall above to top. A Bristol Lass S Start below a left-facing corner, which is directly above the left end of the ledge. Climb the corner. Rock of Ages VS 4c Start on the ledge, 3m right of A Bristol Lass. Climb easily to the overlap, over this steeply on small holds and move a little right to finish. Poorly protected.

The route follows, more or less, the line of the abseil. Pool Corner S Start about 4m. around to the right from December Blue, below the corner at the left end of the wall. This wall overlooks a large platform with a pool at its centre. Climb the thin crack in the corner and continue over ledges to the abseil block. Pool Corner Big High VS 4c This route takes the thin crack one meter R of the corner crack of Pool Corner. Bang E1 5b Start 2m right of Pool Corner, just left of a roof at head height. Climb the thin crack that runs up the left-hand side of the roof to a ledge at 4m. Climb the corner above to the top. Astralasia HVS 5a Start below the first corner to the right of Bang. Climb the thin crack to a small roof. Move right at the roof to a small ledge. Step up left into the groove and up to the top. By Memory Inspired HS 4a Start beneath the obvious corner immediately right of the rock fall area. Climb the corner on good holds, moving left when above the quartzite projections, then back slightly right to belay on a good ledge, in a corner just below the top. By Memory Inspired HS 4a After the Rain HVS 5a Start beneath the next corner to the right. Climb the corner and go up right of the block. Gain the top of the block and go up diagonally left. Climb the corner above onto slab. Step left for belay on large ledge. N.B. The corner above the slab is loose and broken. Two for Tea VS4c Start at the extreme righthand end of the pool platform, on the left edge of a narrow zawn. Climb diagonally left into the corner and move up to where a narrow, vegetated crack system slopes up right. Follow this delicately to exit on the platform above. An Lúidín. (Map M1, M4, M5). The little finger of rock forming a promontory (shown clearly on the map) just west of Basecamp. It is separated from Basecamp Wall by a deep wide crack, bridged by a chockstone. The S facing wall is a suntrap and offers excellent climbing on sound rock, while there are some easier routes on the inland side. Approach. From Basecamp scramble down over easy rock to the west (right facing out) of the narrow corner of Written in Stone and move around west to the chockstone. Step across the crack and move along the crest to the large boss at the west end. The foot of the climbs on either side can be reached by abseiling from here. The first three routes are non-tidal and are on the inland (north) side, overlooking Cuaisin Caol. Doyle's Corner S Abseil down the crack on the north side to a stance just above the high-water mark. Climb steeply leftwards over a bulge to reach easier ground. Cuaisín Crack VD Start as for Doyles Corner. Climb the crack to the boss. Lone Sea Breakers S Start as for above. Climb diagonally right for 6m then move straight up to finish on the boss. The following climbs are all on the south-facing side of An Luidin and are accessed by abseiling down the face, following the line of the deep crack below the boss, or by back-climbing from the boss at about v.diff. Daly Bred S Abseil to the foot of the crack on the south face. Start 3m left of the crack below a ledge at a little over 2m. Gain the ledge and climb the wall near its right edge. Guys & Dolls VS 4c Climb the deep crack, which is steep and juggy. Blind Man HVS 5a Note - A storm has removed the nose mentioned on this route but it does not seem to have altered the grade. Start 2m right of Guys and Dolls and just left of a prominent triangular overhang with a flake crack on its left Climb steeply to a sloping ledge just right of a short nose. Move left around the nose and mantle the pulpit (crux). Step right and follow a groove running from right to left below a higher overhang. Climb directly to the top. Protection adequate. Plain Sailing HS 4b As for Blind Man as far as the sloping ledge. Move up and right to gain the foot of the flake crack. Follow this to the top. Cloudburst E1 5b Start immediately right of Plain Sailing, below a line of ledges. Climb directly up these until a large round hold can be reached (possible wire & friend). From here good holds can be reached up on the right. Reachy moves on good holds lead to good wires and the top. Water Slide VS 4b Start at the right end of this section of the S facing wall, 2m left of the left facing corner. Follow the groove from left to right . Poor Protection. Murphy's Lá VD Start right of Water Slide in a corner. Climb the corner, trending right to the foot of a higher corner capped by an overhang. Climb the right wall of this corner and move out right to finish. The next two climbs start about 12m to the right of Murphy's L?, at the right-hand end of the south facing wall. The most convenient approach to the foot of these two climbs is by abseil, down the crack below the chockstone. Pink Panther VD Start 2m left of January Sun in the right facing corner. Up the corner and over ledges to the foot of a flake crack. Climb this. January Sun S Start at the extreme right of the platform, at the bottom left of the wide crack with the chockstone. Follow the left edge of the crack. Condor. S Hop across the channel to the right edge of the wide crack below the chockstone. Climb the edge. ==Cuaisín Caol Wall== (Map M5). This is the wall facing the north side of An Lúidín, from across the narrow cove of Cuasin Caol. The left-hand section of the wall is topped by a series of platforms, or wide ledges, many of which are littered with debris, while the right-hand end has a pair of fine corners, before petering out in a steep, narrow, boulder filled gully. Just opposite the tip of An Lúidín, there is a platform with some debris on its west side and a block sitting near the edge. An abseil stake has been put in place above this, between the embankment and the edge of the cliff. Abseil down onto the platform. Two pitons have been left insitu on the platform, from which a further abseil can be made (satisfy yourself that they are ok before using them) to a large sloping ledge about 6m above high water mark. The first two climbs start from here. (An alternative approach to these two climbs is to do the first pitch of Stampede). Note - the first three climbs finish up through an area with a lot of loose debris lying on ledges and great care is needed to avoid any stonefall Beetember HS 4a A fine start leads to a loose finish. Start from the large ledge, directly below the abseil point, just right of a step at the foot of a right facing corner. Climb the corner and continue over a slight bulge to reach a long ledge near its left end, below the wall with the quartz patches. Move a little right and carefully climb the wall to the abseil platform. Scramble carefully off. Caol Uisce HS 4b A fine start leads to a loose finish. Start at the foot of a long, right facing corner, reached by an airy step around from the right end of the large sloping ledge mentioned above. Climb the corner on good holds and trend carefully up left over two ledges to reach the platform with the pegs. Scramble carefully off. Stampede HS 4a Easy climbing leads to a loose finish. Low to half tide. Approach from Basecamp scramble down over easy rock and move west to the chockstone bridging the crack. Scramble down the edge of the slab to the boulders at the water's edge. Start just above and right of a huge red boulder, on a large, flat boulder below a wide crack. The crack runs up to the right end of a long ramp sloping up left. 1. VD Steep moves on big holds lead to easier climbing and the foot of the ramp. Follow this easily to a block belay 2m right of the first of two right facing corners. Pitch 2. 4a. Climb the corner, passing a steep section (crux), and step left at the jammed block. Move carefully left and climb a series of steps, trending left to reach the platform with the peg belays. Scramble off from here. Slí na Sláinte HVS 5a Protection is adequate and the interest is continuous. Start as for Stampede. Pitch 1, 5a. Climb the crack to where the angle eases just below the overhang. Traverse right on a footledge for 2m and pull over the bulge. Climb the left-trending crack to the top of the block and the steep corner above it. Several mantelshelves, one of which is difficult, lead to the foot of a second steep corner. Climb this to a wide, sloping, grassy ledge and move up to a sling and nut belay on a large flake. Pitch 2, VD Traverse right for 4m, step across right and climb the top of Sliabh Geal gCua to a metal spike belay just below the bank. Sliabh Geal gCua VS 4c Easier than it looks. Half-tide. Start 2m right of above, below the obvious long corner line. An overhanging start on good holds leads to some mantelshelves and a short, thin section, which is difficult to protect, before gaining the crack in the upper section. Straightforward lay-backing and bridging lead to a good incut ledge and the end of the difficulties. Continue easily up the corner and scramble up a short grassy section to a metal belay stake. (On the first ascent a peg was placed just above the incut ledge, with the intention of abseiling off, to avoid loose blocks above. The peg was too poor to be trusted, however, so an escape left was made. This upper section, which goes at about v. diff., was subsequently cleaned and climbed) Pinnacle Crack HS The pinnacle blocking the boulder filled gully to the right of Sliabh Geal gCua. It has a deep chimney on its right and two shorter corner cracks on its face. Start below the right facing corner crack on the face. Climb the corner to a spike belay, just below the top of the pinnacle. Abseil off (long sling needed). ==Basecampwall== Map M5. The slightly overhanging wall directly below the west side of Basecamp. A low arch, running east-west, pierces it. From Basecamp scramble down seaward on easy rock and move west to cross the narrow cleft onto An Lúidín just above a large chockstone. Move down the slab to the mouth of the arch for the next route. Stairway to Paradise HS 4b Start at the right side of the arch, at the foot of the obvious stepped ramp running up left. Follow the ramp to the top. Care needed with the rock April Airs VS 4b Start 4m right of Stairway to Paradise, below a slanting crack that starts 3m up the wall and runs up to a shoulder. Climb steeply to the crack, follow this to the shoulder and climb the short wall above. ==The Capstone== Map M6. It is worthwhile dropping down to Basecamp to get a fix on the position of the Capstone before approaching it. Cuasín Caol. A = Capstone. B = Beetember. C = Doyle's Corner. To reach the Capstone from Basecamp, return to the bank junction and continue west along the bank for about 45m, until directly above a large platform with a boulder sitting at its centre. Scramble down carefully (or abseil) to the platform and abseil from the boulder, directly to the Capstone for the Left Wall, or down the corner for the Right Wall. Capstone Left Wall. This is the first section of the Capstone area and is reached by scrambling down left (west) from the Capstone to gain the top of the ramp that runs down across the wall. Continue down to the foot of the ramp (one awkward section) and move up to reach a wide platform just right of Foilbeg, the zawn that marks the left or west edge of this area. The wall looks impressive but, on the central section, the quality deteriorates with height. West End Wall S Start 3m right of the edge. Follow a line, more or less direct, to the platform on top. (N.B. If tidal conditions rule out the traverse across from the Capstone, it is possible to abseil from this platform to the foot of the climb). Corn Flakes VS 4b From the right -hand end of the ramp, move 10m(?) left and climb an overhang which leads to a corner running from right to left. Good rock and good protection at the bottom of the corner leads to poor rock and poor protection above. Red Rocks HS Start near the top of the ramp, below and right of an obvious crack in the short, red headwall. Up steeply on good holds (no protection) to the foot of a slab. Gain the slab via a high step, move up and mantelshelf onto a ledge below the crack in the wall. Climb this or the shallow corner on the right. Capstone Lower Buttress. The next three routes are on the buttress directly below the Capstone and are reached by abseiling from the left (west) side of the Capstone down a corner to a barnacle-covered ledge just below the high water mark. Capstone Crack VD Climb the corner to the Capstone and continue to the platform above. Capstone left Corner VD Start about 3m right of Capstone Crack, below a short left facing corner with a crack. Climb the corner to a sloping ledge below a second corner. Steeply up this to the Capstone. Capstone right corner VD Start 2m right of Capstone Left Corner, below a short right facing corner. Climb the corner, move right and up to the Capstone. Capstone Right Wall Map M6. This wall is protected from westerly winds and, as a result, is often climbable when other areas are waveswept. The climbs are reached by abseiling down the corner to the east of the block on the platform or by scrambling down right (east) from The Capstone to the foot of the slab. Odhrán HVS 5a Start below the overhang at the foot of the slab and just right of a shallow cave. Climb the overhang for 4m, move right to good handhold and pull up on increasingly good holds to a large ledge. Move left and finish up the obvious corner. Cú Uladh S Start at the left end of the ledge system, on a ledge on the high-water mark, or a higher ledge if the tide is in, below a short, narrow corner, formed by a flake, near the top of the crag. Climb up and enter the corner which leads to the platform, just right of Odhrán. The Music Makers S Start 3m right of Cú Uladh, below and just right of the right-facing open-book corner.

Start as for Music Makers, below and left of protruding V-shaped block. Climb left-hand side of block to large ledge and clean left facing corner. Climb the corner (crux)to reach the right hand end of the large platform. Sacralicious HVS 5a Start just right of A little Help From My Friends. Climb a corner to a large ledge. Step left and climb the right side of the large protruding block. From the top of the block move right to a small ledge then up and back left to finish. Small friends for protection. Dúlamán VS 5a Start to the right of Sacralicious, below a short corner. Climb the corner to the large sloping ledge. Make a difficult move to gain the small ledge below a crack sloping up left. Climb the crack to a stake belay. Well protected. Tracy VS4c Start below the right end of the wide sloping ledge, behind the squat sea stack (Tuar). Climb to the sloping ledge. Move 2m left to a small niche. Up and back right on small holds to finish on a ledge (avoid loose rock slightly to left of top section). add comment The headland between Foilbeg and Foilmore has some steep rock, but there appears to be a horizontal band of bad rock running across the upper section. ==Foilnadilisk Head== Map M1, M7. This area is demarcated on the left (west), by a narrow zawn, Foilnadilisk and on the right (east), by a smaller zawn, Foileen. Approach. As for Basecamp as far as the junction of the earthen banks. Move up along the bank and follow a higher bank and fence west above the cliffs for a further 150m, passing two zawns to reach the headland between Foileen and Foilnadilisk. Scramble down over rough, steep ground to a wide ledge with a pile of blocks. Abseil from the blocks to the foot of the wall. From the base of the wall move west for about 150m, scramble around back of small zawn, then down to platform at sea level (a small inlet bisects this). The crag is on the left, an obvious clean face, while the arete is immediately to the right, practically at the end of the inlet. All the climbs are short, but worthwhile Beta Blockers HS Start below a strange block formation near the left end of the wall. Climb up through the blocks to top.

The left-hand section of the wall is topped by a series of platforms, or wide ledges, many of which are littered with debris, while the right-hand end has a pair of fine corners, before petering out in a steep, narrow, boulder filled gully. Just opposite the tip of An Lúidín, there is a platform with some debris on its west side and a block sitting near the edge. An abseil stake has been put in place above this, between the embankment and the edge of the cliff. Abseil down onto the platform. Two pitons have been left insitu on the platform, from which a further abseil can be made (satisfy yourself that they are ok before using them) to a large sloping ledge about 6m above high water mark. The first two climbs start from here. (An alternative approach to these two climbs is to do the first pitch of Stampede). Note - the first three climbs finish up through an area with a lot of loose debris lying on ledges and great care is needed to avoid any stonefall Beetember HS 4a A fine start leads to a loose finish. Start from the large ledge, directly below the abseil point, just right of a step at the foot of a right facing corner. Climb the corner and continue over a slight bulge to reach a long ledge near its left end, below the wall with the quartz patches.

Climb the left-trending crack to the top of the block and the steep corner above it. Several mantelshelves, one of which is difficult, lead to the foot of a second steep corner. Climb this to a wide, sloping, grassy ledge and move up to a sling and nut belay on a large flake. Pitch 2, VD Traverse right for 4m, step across right and climb the top of Sliabh Geal gCua to a metal spike belay just below the bank. Sliabh Geal gCua VS 4c Easier than it looks. Half-tide. Start 2m right of above, below the obvious long corner line. An overhanging start on good holds leads to some mantelshelves and a short, thin section, which is difficult to protect, before gaining the crack in the upper section. Straightforward lay-backing and bridging lead to a good incut ledge and the end of the difficulties. Continue easily up the corner and scramble up a short grassy section to a metal belay stake. (On the first ascent a peg was placed just above the incut ledge, with the intention of abseiling off, to avoid loose blocks above. The peg was too poor to be trusted, however, so an escape left was made. This upper section, which goes at about v. diff., was subsequently cleaned and climbed) Pinnacle Crack HS The pinnacle blocking the boulder filled gully to the right of Sliabh Geal gCua. It has a deep chimney on its right and two shorter corner cracks on its face. Start below the right facing corner crack on the face. Climb the corner to a spike belay, just below the top of the pinnacle. Abseil off (long sling needed). ==Basecampwall== Map M5. The slightly overhanging wall directly below the west side of Basecamp.

The first three routes are non-tidal and are on the inland (north) side, overlooking Cuaisin Caol. Doyle's Corner S Abseil down the crack on the north side to a stance just above the high-water mark. Climb steeply leftwards over a bulge to reach easier ground. Cuaisín Crack VD Start as for Doyles Corner. Climb the crack to the boss. Lone Sea Breakers S Start as for above. Climb diagonally right for 6m then move straight up to finish on the boss. The following climbs are all on the south-facing side of An Luidin and are accessed by abseiling down the face, following the line of the deep crack below the boss, or by back-climbing from the boss at about v.diff. Daly Bred S Abseil to the foot of the crack on the south face. Start 3m left of the crack below a ledge at a little over 2m. Gain the ledge and climb the wall near its right edge. Guys & Dolls VS 4c Climb the deep crack, which is steep and juggy. Blind Man HVS 5a Note - A storm has removed the nose mentioned on this route but it does not seem to have altered the grade. Start 2m right of Guys and Dolls and just left of a prominent triangular overhang with a flake crack on its left Climb steeply to a sloping ledge just right of a short nose. Move left around the nose and mantle the pulpit (crux). Step right and follow a groove running from right to left below a higher overhang. Climb directly to the top. Protection adequate. Plain Sailing HS 4b As for Blind Man as far as the sloping ledge. Move up and right to gain the foot of the flake crack. Follow this to the top. Cloudburst E1 5b Start immediately right of Plain Sailing, below a line of ledges. Climb directly up these until a large round hold can be reached (possible wire & friend). From here good holds can be reached up on the right. Reachy moves on good holds lead to good wires and the top. Water Slide VS 4b Start at the right end of this section of the S facing wall, 2m left of the left facing corner. Follow the groove from left to right . Poor Protection. Murphy's Lá VD Start right of Water Slide in a corner. Climb the corner, trending right to the foot of a higher corner capped by an overhang. Climb the right wall of this corner and move out right to finish. The next two climbs start about 12m to the right of Murphy's L?, at the right-hand end of the south facing wall. The most convenient approach to the foot of these two climbs is by abseil, down the crack below the chockstone. Pink Panther VD Start 2m left of January Sun in the right facing corner. Up the corner and over ledges to the foot of a flake crack. Climb this. January Sun S Start at the extreme right of the platform, at the bottom left of the wide crack with the chockstone. Follow the left edge of the crack. Condor. S Hop across the channel to the right edge of the wide crack below the chockstone. Climb the edge. ==Cuaisín Caol Wall== (Map M5). This is the wall facing the north side of An Lúidín, from across the narrow cove of Cuasin Caol. The left-hand section of the wall is topped by a series of platforms, or wide ledges, many of which are littered with debris, while the right-hand end has a pair of fine corners, before petering out in a steep, narrow, boulder filled gully. Just opposite the tip of An Lúidín, there is a platform with some debris on its west side and a block sitting near the edge. An abseil stake has been put in place above this, between the embankment and the edge of the cliff. Abseil down onto the platform. Two pitons have been left insitu on the platform, from which a further abseil can be made (satisfy yourself that they are ok before using them) to a large sloping ledge about 6m above high water mark. The first two climbs start from here. (An alternative approach to these two climbs is to do the first pitch of Stampede). Note - the first three climbs finish up through an area with a lot of loose debris lying on ledges and great care is needed to avoid any stonefall Beetember HS 4a A fine start leads to a loose finish. Start from the large ledge, directly below the abseil point, just right of a step at the foot of a right facing corner. Climb the corner and continue over a slight bulge to reach a long ledge near its left end, below the wall with the quartz patches. Move a little right and carefully climb the wall to the abseil platform. Scramble carefully off. Caol Uisce HS 4b A fine start leads to a loose finish. Start at the foot of a long, right facing corner, reached by an airy step around from the right end of the large sloping ledge mentioned above. Climb the corner on good holds and trend carefully up left over two ledges to reach the platform with the pegs. Scramble carefully off. Stampede HS 4a Easy climbing leads to a loose finish. Low to half tide. Approach from Basecamp scramble down over easy rock and move west to the chockstone bridging the crack. Scramble down the edge of the slab to the boulders at the water's edge. Start just above and right of a huge red boulder, on a large, flat boulder below a wide crack. The crack runs up to the right end of a long ramp sloping up left. 1. VD Steep moves on big holds lead to easier climbing and the foot of the ramp. Follow this easily to a block belay 2m right of the first of two right facing corners. Pitch 2. 4a. Climb the corner, passing a steep section (crux), and step left at the jammed block. Move carefully left and climb a series of steps, trending left to reach the platform with the peg belays. Scramble off from here. Slí na Sláinte HVS 5a Protection is adequate and the interest is continuous. Start as for Stampede. Pitch 1, 5a. Climb the crack to where the angle eases just below the overhang. Traverse right on a footledge for 2m and pull over the bulge. Climb the left-trending crack to the top of the block and the steep corner above it. Several mantelshelves, one of which is difficult, lead to the foot of a second steep corner. Climb this to a wide, sloping, grassy ledge and move up to a sling and nut belay on a large flake. Pitch 2, VD Traverse right for 4m, step across right and climb the top of Sliabh Geal gCua to a metal spike belay just below the bank. Sliabh Geal gCua VS 4c Easier than it looks. Half-tide. Start 2m right of above, below the obvious long corner line. An overhanging start on good holds leads to some mantelshelves and a short, thin section, which is difficult to protect, before gaining the crack in the upper section. Straightforward lay-backing and bridging lead to a good incut ledge and the end of the difficulties. Continue easily up the corner and scramble up a short grassy section to a metal belay stake. (On the first ascent a peg was placed just above the incut ledge, with the intention of abseiling off, to avoid loose blocks above. The peg was too poor to be trusted, however, so an escape left was made. This upper section, which goes at about v. diff., was subsequently cleaned and climbed) Pinnacle Crack HS The pinnacle blocking the boulder filled gully to the right of Sliabh Geal gCua. It has a deep chimney on its right and two shorter corner cracks on its face. Start below the right facing corner crack on the face. Climb the corner to a spike belay, just below the top of the pinnacle. Abseil off (long sling needed). ==Basecampwall== Map M5. The slightly overhanging wall directly below the west side of Basecamp.

Climb steeply to the crack, follow this to the shoulder and climb the short wall above. ==The Capstone== Map M6. It is worthwhile dropping down to Basecamp to get a fix on the position of the Capstone before approaching it. Cuasín Caol. A = Capstone. B = Beetember. C = Doyle's Corner. To reach the Capstone from Basecamp, return to the bank junction and continue west along the bank for about 45m, until directly above a large platform with a boulder sitting at its centre. Scramble down carefully (or abseil) to the platform and abseil from the boulder, directly to the Capstone for the Left Wall, or down the corner for the Right Wall. Capstone Left Wall. This is the first section of the Capstone area and is reached by scrambling down left (west) from the Capstone to gain the top of the ramp that runs down across the wall. Continue down to the foot of the ramp (one awkward section) and move up to reach a wide platform just right of Foilbeg, the zawn that marks the left or west edge of this area. The wall looks impressive but, on the central section, the quality deteriorates with height. West End Wall S Start 3m right of the edge. Follow a line, more or less direct, to the platform on top. (N.B. If tidal conditions rule out the traverse across from the Capstone, it is possible to abseil from this platform to the foot of the climb). Corn Flakes VS 4b From the right -hand end of the ramp, move 10m(?) left and climb an overhang which leads to a corner running from right to left. Good rock and good protection at the bottom of the corner leads to poor rock and poor protection above. Red Rocks HS Start near the top of the ramp, below and right of an obvious crack in the short, red headwall. Up steeply on good holds (no protection) to the foot of a slab. Gain the slab via a high step, move up and mantelshelf onto a ledge below the crack in the wall. Climb this or the shallow corner on the right. Capstone Lower Buttress.

The little finger of rock forming a promontory (shown clearly on the map) just west of Basecamp. It is separated from Basecamp Wall by a deep wide crack, bridged by a chockstone. The S facing wall is a suntrap and offers excellent climbing on sound rock, while there are some easier routes on the inland side. Approach. From Basecamp scramble down over easy rock to the west (right facing out) of the narrow corner of Written in Stone and move around west to the chockstone. Step across the crack and move along the crest to the large boss at the west end. The foot of the climbs on either side can be reached by abseiling from here. The first three routes are non-tidal and are on the inland (north) side, overlooking Cuaisin Caol. Doyle's Corner S Abseil down the crack on the north side to a stance just above the high-water mark. Climb steeply leftwards over a bulge to reach easier ground. Cuaisín Crack VD Start as for Doyles Corner. Climb the crack to the boss. Lone Sea Breakers S Start as for above. Climb diagonally right for 6m then move straight up to finish on the boss. The following climbs are all on the south-facing side of An Luidin and are accessed by abseiling down the face, following the line of the deep crack below the boss, or by back-climbing from the boss at about v.diff. Daly Bred S Abseil to the foot of the crack on the south face. Start 3m left of the crack below a ledge at a little over 2m. Gain the ledge and climb the wall near its right edge. Guys & Dolls VS 4c Climb the deep crack, which is steep and juggy. Blind Man HVS 5a Note - A storm has removed the nose mentioned on this route but it does not seem to have altered the grade. Start 2m right of Guys and Dolls and just left of a prominent triangular overhang with a flake crack on its left Climb steeply to a sloping ledge just right of a short nose. Move left around the nose and mantle the pulpit (crux). Step right and follow a groove running from right to left below a higher overhang. Climb directly to the top. Protection adequate. Plain Sailing HS 4b As for Blind Man as far as the sloping ledge. Move up and right to gain the foot of the flake crack. Follow this to the top. Cloudburst E1 5b Start immediately right of Plain Sailing, below a line of ledges. Climb directly up these until a large round hold can be reached (possible wire & friend). From here good holds can be reached up on the right. Reachy moves on good holds lead to good wires and the top. Water Slide VS 4b Start at the right end of this section of the S facing wall, 2m left of the left facing corner. Follow the groove from left to right . Poor Protection. Murphy's Lá VD Start right of Water Slide in a corner. Climb the corner, trending right to the foot of a higher corner capped by an overhang. Climb the right wall of this corner and move out right to finish. The next two climbs start about 12m to the right of Murphy's L?, at the right-hand end of the south facing wall. The most convenient approach to the foot of these two climbs is by abseil, down the crack below the chockstone. Pink Panther VD Start 2m left of January Sun in the right facing corner. Up the corner and over ledges to the foot of a flake crack. Climb this. January Sun S Start at the extreme right of the platform, at the bottom left of the wide crack with the chockstone. Follow the left edge of the crack. Condor. S Hop across the channel to the right edge of the wide crack below the chockstone. Climb the edge. ==Cuaisín Caol Wall== (Map M5). This is the wall facing the north side of An Lúidín, from across the narrow cove of Cuasin Caol. The left-hand section of the wall is topped by a series of platforms, or wide ledges, many of which are littered with debris, while the right-hand end has a pair of fine corners, before petering out in a steep, narrow, boulder filled gully. Just opposite the tip of An Lúidín, there is a platform with some debris on its west side and a block sitting near the edge. An abseil stake has been put in place above this, between the embankment and the edge of the cliff. Abseil down onto the platform. Two pitons have been left insitu on the platform, from which a further abseil can be made (satisfy yourself that they are ok before using them) to a large sloping ledge about 6m above high water mark. The first two climbs start from here. (An alternative approach to these two climbs is to do the first pitch of Stampede). Note - the first three climbs finish up through an area with a lot of loose debris lying on ledges and great care is needed to avoid any stonefall Beetember HS 4a A fine start leads to a loose finish. Start from the large ledge, directly below the abseil point, just right of a step at the foot of a right facing corner. Climb the corner and continue over a slight bulge to reach a long ledge near its left end, below the wall with the quartz patches. Move a little right and carefully climb the wall to the abseil platform. Scramble carefully off. Caol Uisce HS 4b A fine start leads to a loose finish. Start at the foot of a long, right facing corner, reached by an airy step around from the right end of the large sloping ledge mentioned above. Climb the corner on good holds and trend carefully up left over two ledges to reach the platform with the pegs. Scramble carefully off. Stampede HS 4a Easy climbing leads to a loose finish. Low to half tide. Approach from Basecamp scramble down over easy rock and move west to the chockstone bridging the crack. Scramble down the edge of the slab to the boulders at the water's edge. Start just above and right of a huge red boulder, on a large, flat boulder below a wide crack. The crack runs up to the right end of a long ramp sloping up left. 1. VD Steep moves on big holds lead to easier climbing and the foot of the ramp. Follow this easily to a block belay 2m right of the first of two right facing corners. Pitch 2. 4a. Climb the corner, passing a steep section (crux), and step left at the jammed block. Move carefully left and climb a series of steps, trending left to reach the platform with the peg belays. Scramble off from here. Slí na Sláinte HVS 5a Protection is adequate and the interest is continuous. Start as for Stampede. Pitch 1, 5a. Climb the crack to where the angle eases just below the overhang. Traverse right on a footledge for 2m and pull over the bulge. Climb the left-trending crack to the top of the block and the steep corner above it. Several mantelshelves, one of which is difficult, lead to the foot of a second steep corner. Climb this to a wide, sloping, grassy ledge and move up to a sling and nut belay on a large flake. Pitch 2, VD Traverse right for 4m, step across right and climb the top of Sliabh Geal gCua to a metal spike belay just below the bank. Sliabh Geal gCua VS 4c Easier than it looks. Half-tide. Start 2m right of above, below the obvious long corner line. An overhanging start on good holds leads to some mantelshelves and a short, thin section, which is difficult to protect, before gaining the crack in the upper section. Straightforward lay-backing and bridging lead to a good incut ledge and the end of the difficulties. Continue easily up the corner and scramble up a short grassy section to a metal belay stake. (On the first ascent a peg was placed just above the incut ledge, with the intention of abseiling off, to avoid loose blocks above. The peg was too poor to be trusted, however, so an escape left was made. This upper section, which goes at about v. diff., was subsequently cleaned and climbed) Pinnacle Crack HS The pinnacle blocking the boulder filled gully to the right of Sliabh Geal gCua. It has a deep chimney on its right and two shorter corner cracks on its face. Start below the right facing corner crack on the face. Climb the corner to a spike belay, just below the top of the pinnacle. Abseil off (long sling needed). ==Basecampwall== Map M5. The slightly overhanging wall directly below the west side of Basecamp. A low arch, running east-west, pierces it. From Basecamp scramble down seaward on easy rock and move west to cross the narrow cleft onto An Lúidín just above a large chockstone. Move down the slab to the mouth of the arch for the next route. Stairway to Paradise HS 4b Start at the right side of the arch, at the foot of the obvious stepped ramp running up left. Follow the ramp to the top. Care needed with the rock April Airs VS 4b Start 4m right of Stairway to Paradise, below a slanting crack that starts 3m up the wall and runs up to a shoulder. Climb steeply to the crack, follow this to the shoulder and climb the short wall above. ==The Capstone== Map M6. It is worthwhile dropping down to Basecamp to get a fix on the position of the Capstone before approaching it. Cuasín Caol. A = Capstone. B = Beetember. C = Doyle's Corner. To reach the Capstone from Basecamp, return to the bank junction and continue west along the bank for about 45m, until directly above a large platform with a boulder sitting at its centre. Scramble down carefully (or abseil) to the platform and abseil from the boulder, directly to the Capstone for the Left Wall, or down the corner for the Right Wall. Capstone Left Wall. This is the first section of the Capstone area and is reached by scrambling down left (west) from the Capstone to gain the top of the ramp that runs down across the wall. Continue down to the foot of the ramp (one awkward section) and move up to reach a wide platform just right of Foilbeg, the zawn that marks the left or west edge of this area. The wall looks impressive but, on the central section, the quality deteriorates with height. West End Wall S Start 3m right of the edge. Follow a line, more or less direct, to the platform on top. (N.B. If tidal conditions rule out the traverse across from the Capstone, it is possible to abseil from this platform to the foot of the climb). Corn Flakes VS 4b From the right -hand end of the ramp, move 10m(?) left and climb an overhang which leads to a corner running from right to left. Good rock and good protection at the bottom of the corner leads to poor rock and poor protection above. Red Rocks HS Start near the top of the ramp, below and right of an obvious crack in the short, red headwall. Up steeply on good holds (no protection) to the foot of a slab. Gain the slab via a high step, move up and mantelshelf onto a ledge below the crack in the wall. Climb this or the shallow corner on the right. Capstone Lower Buttress. The next three routes are on the buttress directly below the Capstone and are reached by abseiling from the left (west) side of the Capstone down a corner to a barnacle-covered ledge just below the high water mark. Capstone Crack VD Climb the corner to the Capstone and continue to the platform above. Capstone left Corner VD Start about 3m right of Capstone Crack, below a short left facing corner with a crack. Climb the corner to a sloping ledge below a second corner. Steeply up this to the Capstone. Capstone right corner VD Start 2m right of Capstone Left Corner, below a short right facing corner. Climb the corner, move right and up to the Capstone. Capstone Right Wall Map M6. This wall is protected from westerly winds and, as a result, is often climbable when other areas are waveswept. The climbs are reached by abseiling down the corner to the east of the block on the platform or by scrambling down right (east) from The Capstone to the foot of the slab. Odhrán HVS 5a Start below the overhang at the foot of the slab and just right of a shallow cave. Climb the overhang for 4m, move right to good handhold and pull up on increasingly good holds to a large ledge. Move left and finish up the obvious corner. Cú Uladh S Start at the left end of the ledge system, on a ledge on the high-water mark, or a higher ledge if the tide is in, below a short, narrow corner, formed by a flake, near the top of the crag. Climb up and enter the corner which leads to the platform, just right of Odhrán. The Music Makers S Start 3m right of Cú Uladh, below and just right of the right-facing open-book corner.

Start as for Music Makers, below and left of protruding V-shaped block. Climb left-hand side of block to large ledge and clean left facing corner. Climb the corner (crux)to reach the right hand end of the large platform. Sacralicious HVS 5a Start just right of A little Help From My Friends. Climb a corner to a large ledge. Step left and climb the right side of the large protruding block. From the top of the block move right to a small ledge then up and back left to finish. Small friends for protection. Dúlamán VS 5a Start to the right of Sacralicious, below a short corner. Climb the corner to the large sloping ledge. Make a difficult move to gain the small ledge below a crack sloping up left. Climb the crack to a stake belay. Well protected. Tracy VS4c Start below the right end of the wide sloping ledge, behind the squat sea stack (Tuar). Climb to the sloping ledge. Move 2m left to a small niche. Up and back right on small holds to finish on a ledge (avoid loose rock slightly to left of top section). add comment The headland between Foilbeg and Foilmore has some steep rock, but there appears to be a horizontal band of bad rock running across the upper section. ==Foilnadilisk Head== Map M1, M7. This area is demarcated on the left (west), by a narrow zawn, Foilnadilisk and on the right (east), by a smaller zawn, Foileen. Approach. As for Basecamp as far as the junction of the earthen banks. Move up along the bank and follow a higher bank and fence west above the cliffs for a further 150m, passing two zawns to reach the headland between Foileen and Foilnadilisk. Scramble down over rough, steep ground to a wide ledge with a pile of blocks. Abseil from the blocks to the foot of the wall. From the base of the wall move west for about 150m, scramble around back of small zawn, then down to platform at sea level (a small inlet bisects this). The crag is on the left, an obvious clean face, while the arete is immediately to the right, practically at the end of the inlet.

Move down the slab to the mouth of the arch for the next route. Stairway to Paradise HS 4b Start at the right side of the arch, at the foot of the obvious stepped ramp running up left. Follow the ramp to the top. Care needed with the rock April Airs VS 4b Start 4m right of Stairway to Paradise, below a slanting crack that starts 3m up the wall and runs up to a shoulder. Climb steeply to the crack, follow this to the shoulder and climb the short wall above. ==The Capstone== Map M6. It is worthwhile dropping down to Basecamp to get a fix on the position of the Capstone before approaching it. Cuasín Caol. A = Capstone. B = Beetember. C = Doyle's Corner. To reach the Capstone from Basecamp, return to the bank junction and continue west along the bank for about 45m, until directly above a large platform with a boulder sitting at its centre. Scramble down carefully (or abseil) to the platform and abseil from the boulder, directly to the Capstone for the Left Wall, or down the corner for the Right Wall. Capstone Left Wall. This is the first section of the Capstone area and is reached by scrambling down left (west) from the Capstone to gain the top of the ramp that runs down across the wall. Continue down to the foot of the ramp (one awkward section) and move up to reach a wide platform just right of Foilbeg, the zawn that marks the left or west edge of this area. The wall looks impressive but, on the central section, the quality deteriorates with height. West End Wall S Start 3m right of the edge. Follow a line, more or less direct, to the platform on top. (N.B. If tidal conditions rule out the traverse across from the Capstone, it is possible to abseil from this platform to the foot of the climb). Corn Flakes VS 4b From the right -hand end of the ramp, move 10m(?) left and climb an overhang which leads to a corner running from right to left. Good rock and good protection at the bottom of the corner leads to poor rock and poor protection above. Red Rocks HS Start near the top of the ramp, below and right of an obvious crack in the short, red headwall. Up steeply on good holds (no protection) to the foot of a slab. Gain the slab via a high step, move up and mantelshelf onto a ledge below the crack in the wall. Climb this or the shallow corner on the right. Capstone Lower Buttress. The next three routes are on the buttress directly below the Capstone and are reached by abseiling from the left (west) side of the Capstone down a corner to a barnacle-covered ledge just below the high water mark. Capstone Crack VD Climb the corner to the Capstone and continue to the platform above. Capstone left Corner VD Start about 3m right of Capstone Crack, below a short left facing corner with a crack. Climb the corner to a sloping ledge below a second corner. Steeply up this to the Capstone. Capstone right corner VD Start 2m right of Capstone Left Corner, below a short right facing corner. Climb the corner, move right and up to the Capstone. Capstone Right Wall Map M6. This wall is protected from westerly winds and, as a result, is often climbable when other areas are waveswept. The climbs are reached by abseiling down the corner to the east of the block on the platform or by scrambling down right (east) from The Capstone to the foot of the slab. Odhrán HVS 5a Start below the overhang at the foot of the slab and just right of a shallow cave. Climb the overhang for 4m, move right to good handhold and pull up on increasingly good holds to a large ledge. Move left and finish up the obvious corner. Cú Uladh S Start at the left end of the ledge system, on a ledge on the high-water mark, or a higher ledge if the tide is in, below a short, narrow corner, formed by a flake, near the top of the crag. Climb up and enter the corner which leads to the platform, just right of Odhrán. The Music Makers S Start 3m right of Cú Uladh, below and just right of the right-facing open-book corner.

Start as for Music Makers, below and left of protruding V-shaped block. Climb left-hand side of block to large ledge and clean left facing corner. Climb the corner (crux)to reach the right hand end of the large platform. Sacralicious HVS 5a Start just right of A little Help From My Friends. Climb a corner to a large ledge. Step left and climb the right side of the large protruding block. From the top of the block move right to a small ledge then up and back left to finish. Small friends for protection. Dúlamán VS 5a Start to the right of Sacralicious, below a short corner. Climb the corner to the large sloping ledge. Make a difficult move to gain the small ledge below a crack sloping up left. Climb the crack to a stake belay. Well protected. Tracy VS4c Start below the right end of the wide sloping ledge, behind the squat sea stack (Tuar). Climb to the sloping ledge. Move 2m left to a small niche. Up and back right on small holds to finish on a ledge (avoid loose rock slightly to left of top section). add comment The headland between Foilbeg and Foilmore has some steep rock, but there appears to be a horizontal band of bad rock running across the upper section. ==Foilnadilisk Head== Map M1, M7. This area is demarcated on the left (west), by a narrow zawn, Foilnadilisk and on the right (east), by a smaller zawn, Foileen. Approach. As for Basecamp as far as the junction of the earthen banks. Move up along the bank and follow a higher bank and fence west above the cliffs for a further 150m, passing two zawns to reach the headland between Foileen and Foilnadilisk. Scramble down over rough, steep ground to a wide ledge with a pile of blocks. Abseil from the blocks to the foot of the wall. From the base of the wall move west for about 150m, scramble around back of small zawn, then down to platform at sea level (a small inlet bisects this). The crag is on the left, an obvious clean face, while the arete is immediately to the right, practically at the end of the inlet. All the climbs are short, but worthwhile Beta Blockers HS Start below a strange block formation near the left end of the wall. Climb up through the blocks to top. Fault Line VS 4b Start 2m right of above. Climb the obvious line. Large Triangle. VS 4b. Start 2m right of above. Climb through large triangular niche to top.

            "description": "Drohideen (Map M4). This buttress lies just east of the Tea Flag. Approach. Climb a short step at the back of the Tea Flag and traverse east above a deep corner (the line of Chul na Greine). Scramble down in the direction of a small, circular rock island, to reach a dark ledge on the high-water mark (Note - the deep gully above the rock island has been looked at, but the rock is very poor on the upper section). Chúl na Gréine VS 4c Traverse back west to the end of the ledge. Step down and make a few moves of about Diff., to enter the deep corner on the left. Start from a belay on the large boulders. Climb the crack on the left at the back of the corner to a gap. A difficult move regains the crack, which is followed steeply to where a short, subsidiary crack goes diagonally right. Hand traverse out along this and continue up the narrow chimney. Well protected. (Note - On the first ascent the diagonal crack was followed because the direct finish up the corner was too wet to climb. When dry, the direct would be the logical and better finish, at a grade or two higher). Chúl na Gréine Steeped in Crack HVS 5a Start in the deep corner, as for Chúl na Gréine, below the wide crack on the right side of the corner. Climb the crack over a bulge and continue to the top (good sling at mid-height). Sea Otter HVS 5a Start 2m right of the deep corner, 4m left of the left end of the ledge, below two small overhangs. Climb up over first overhang into a short corner (good brass wire). Climb the second overhang (crux, 2 1/2 friend) and another short corner above to large holds in scoop (sling).

The little finger of rock forming a promontory (shown clearly on the map) just west of Basecamp. It is separated from Basecamp Wall by a deep wide crack, bridged by a chockstone. The S facing wall is a suntrap and offers excellent climbing on sound rock, while there are some easier routes on the inland side. Approach. From Basecamp scramble down over easy rock to the west (right facing out) of the narrow corner of Written in Stone and move around west to the chockstone. Step across the crack and move along the crest to the large boss at the west end. The foot of the climbs on either side can be reached by abseiling from here. The first three routes are non-tidal and are on the inland (north) side, overlooking Cuaisin Caol. Doyle's Corner S Abseil down the crack on the north side to a stance just above the high-water mark. Climb steeply leftwards over a bulge to reach easier ground. Cuaisín Crack VD Start as for Doyles Corner. Climb the crack to the boss. Lone Sea Breakers S Start as for above. Climb diagonally right for 6m then move straight up to finish on the boss. The following climbs are all on the south-facing side of An Luidin and are accessed by abseiling down the face, following the line of the deep crack below the boss, or by back-climbing from the boss at about v.diff. Daly Bred S Abseil to the foot of the crack on the south face. Start 3m left of the crack below a ledge at a little over 2m. Gain the ledge and climb the wall near its right edge. Guys & Dolls VS 4c Climb the deep crack, which is steep and juggy. Blind Man HVS 5a Note - A storm has removed the nose mentioned on this route but it does not seem to have altered the grade. Start 2m right of Guys and Dolls and just left of a prominent triangular overhang with a flake crack on its left Climb steeply to a sloping ledge just right of a short nose. Move left around the nose and mantle the pulpit (crux). Step right and follow a groove running from right to left below a higher overhang. Climb directly to the top. Protection adequate. Plain Sailing HS 4b As for Blind Man as far as the sloping ledge. Move up and right to gain the foot of the flake crack. Follow this to the top. Cloudburst E1 5b Start immediately right of Plain Sailing, below a line of ledges. Climb directly up these until a large round hold can be reached (possible wire & friend). From here good holds can be reached up on the right. Reachy moves on good holds lead to good wires and the top. Water Slide VS 4b Start at the right end of this section of the S facing wall, 2m left of the left facing corner. Follow the groove from left to right . Poor Protection. Murphy's Lá VD Start right of Water Slide in a corner. Climb the corner, trending right to the foot of a higher corner capped by an overhang. Climb the right wall of this corner and move out right to finish. The next two climbs start about 12m to the right of Murphy's L?, at the right-hand end of the south facing wall. The most convenient approach to the foot of these two climbs is by abseil, down the crack below the chockstone. Pink Panther VD Start 2m left of January Sun in the right facing corner. Up the corner and over ledges to the foot of a flake crack. Climb this. January Sun S Start at the extreme right of the platform, at the bottom left of the wide crack with the chockstone. Follow the left edge of the crack. Condor. S Hop across the channel to the right edge of the wide crack below the chockstone. Climb the edge. ==Cuaisín Caol Wall== (Map M5). This is the wall facing the north side of An Lúidín, from across the narrow cove of Cuasin Caol. The left-hand section of the wall is topped by a series of platforms, or wide ledges, many of which are littered with debris, while the right-hand end has a pair of fine corners, before petering out in a steep, narrow, boulder filled gully. Just opposite the tip of An Lúidín, there is a platform with some debris on its west side and a block sitting near the edge. An abseil stake has been put in place above this, between the embankment and the edge of the cliff. Abseil down onto the platform. Two pitons have been left insitu on the platform, from which a further abseil can be made (satisfy yourself that they are ok before using them) to a large sloping ledge about 6m above high water mark. The first two climbs start from here. (An alternative approach to these two climbs is to do the first pitch of Stampede). Note - the first three climbs finish up through an area with a lot of loose debris lying on ledges and great care is needed to avoid any stonefall Beetember HS 4a A fine start leads to a loose finish. Start from the large ledge, directly below the abseil point, just right of a step at the foot of a right facing corner. Climb the corner and continue over a slight bulge to reach a long ledge near its left end, below the wall with the quartz patches. Move a little right and carefully climb the wall to the abseil platform. Scramble carefully off. Caol Uisce HS 4b A fine start leads to a loose finish. Start at the foot of a long, right facing corner, reached by an airy step around from the right end of the large sloping ledge mentioned above. Climb the corner on good holds and trend carefully up left over two ledges to reach the platform with the pegs. Scramble carefully off. Stampede HS 4a Easy climbing leads to a loose finish. Low to half tide. Approach from Basecamp scramble down over easy rock and move west to the chockstone bridging the crack. Scramble down the edge of the slab to the boulders at the water's edge. Start just above and right of a huge red boulder, on a large, flat boulder below a wide crack. The crack runs up to the right end of a long ramp sloping up left. 1. VD Steep moves on big holds lead to easier climbing and the foot of the ramp. Follow this easily to a block belay 2m right of the first of two right facing corners. Pitch 2. 4a. Climb the corner, passing a steep section (crux), and step left at the jammed block. Move carefully left and climb a series of steps, trending left to reach the platform with the peg belays. Scramble off from here. Slí na Sláinte HVS 5a Protection is adequate and the interest is continuous. Start as for Stampede. Pitch 1, 5a. Climb the crack to where the angle eases just below the overhang. Traverse right on a footledge for 2m and pull over the bulge. Climb the left-trending crack to the top of the block and the steep corner above it. Several mantelshelves, one of which is difficult, lead to the foot of a second steep corner. Climb this to a wide, sloping, grassy ledge and move up to a sling and nut belay on a large flake. Pitch 2, VD Traverse right for 4m, step across right and climb the top of Sliabh Geal gCua to a metal spike belay just below the bank. Sliabh Geal gCua VS 4c Easier than it looks. Half-tide. Start 2m right of above, below the obvious long corner line. An overhanging start on good holds leads to some mantelshelves and a short, thin section, which is difficult to protect, before gaining the crack in the upper section. Straightforward lay-backing and bridging lead to a good incut ledge and the end of the difficulties. Continue easily up the corner and scramble up a short grassy section to a metal belay stake. (On the first ascent a peg was placed just above the incut ledge, with the intention of abseiling off, to avoid loose blocks above. The peg was too poor to be trusted, however, so an escape left was made. This upper section, which goes at about v. diff., was subsequently cleaned and climbed) Pinnacle Crack HS The pinnacle blocking the boulder filled gully to the right of Sliabh Geal gCua. It has a deep chimney on its right and two shorter corner cracks on its face. Start below the right facing corner crack on the face. Climb the corner to a spike belay, just below the top of the pinnacle. Abseil off (long sling needed). ==Basecampwall== Map M5. The slightly overhanging wall directly below the west side of Basecamp. A low arch, running east-west, pierces it. From Basecamp scramble down seaward on easy rock and move west to cross the narrow cleft onto An Lúidín just above a large chockstone.

The left-hand section of the wall is topped by a series of platforms, or wide ledges, many of which are littered with debris, while the right-hand end has a pair of fine corners, before petering out in a steep, narrow, boulder filled gully. Just opposite the tip of An Lúidín, there is a platform with some debris on its west side and a block sitting near the edge. An abseil stake has been put in place above this, between the embankment and the edge of the cliff. Abseil down onto the platform. Two pitons have been left insitu on the platform, from which a further abseil can be made (satisfy yourself that they are ok before using them) to a large sloping ledge about 6m above high water mark. The first two climbs start from here. (An alternative approach to these two climbs is to do the first pitch of Stampede). Note - the first three climbs finish up through an area with a lot of loose debris lying on ledges and great care is needed to avoid any stonefall Beetember HS 4a A fine start leads to a loose finish. Start from the large ledge, directly below the abseil point, just right of a step at the foot of a right facing corner. Climb the corner and continue over a slight bulge to reach a long ledge near its left end, below the wall with the quartz patches.

Climb the left-trending crack to the top of the block and the steep corner above it. Several mantelshelves, one of which is difficult, lead to the foot of a second steep corner. Climb this to a wide, sloping, grassy ledge and move up to a sling and nut belay on a large flake. Pitch 2, VD Traverse right for 4m, step across right and climb the top of Sliabh Geal gCua to a metal spike belay just below the bank. Sliabh Geal gCua VS 4c Easier than it looks. Half-tide. Start 2m right of above, below the obvious long corner line. An overhanging start on good holds leads to some mantelshelves and a short, thin section, which is difficult to protect, before gaining the crack in the upper section. Straightforward lay-backing and bridging lead to a good incut ledge and the end of the difficulties. Continue easily up the corner and scramble up a short grassy section to a metal belay stake. (On the first ascent a peg was placed just above the incut ledge, with the intention of abseiling off, to avoid loose blocks above. The peg was too poor to be trusted, however, so an escape left was made. This upper section, which goes at about v. diff., was subsequently cleaned and climbed) Pinnacle Crack HS The pinnacle blocking the boulder filled gully to the right of Sliabh Geal gCua. It has a deep chimney on its right and two shorter corner cracks on its face. Start below the right facing corner crack on the face. Climb the corner to a spike belay, just below the top of the pinnacle. Abseil off (long sling needed). ==Basecampwall== Map M5. The slightly overhanging wall directly below the west side of Basecamp.

The little finger of rock forming a promontory (shown clearly on the map) just west of Basecamp. It is separated from Basecamp Wall by a deep wide crack, bridged by a chockstone. The S facing wall is a suntrap and offers excellent climbing on sound rock, while there are some easier routes on the inland side. Approach. From Basecamp scramble down over easy rock to the west (right facing out) of the narrow corner of Written in Stone and move around west to the chockstone. Step across the crack and move along the crest to the large boss at the west end. The foot of the climbs on either side can be reached by abseiling from here. The first three routes are non-tidal and are on the inland (north) side, overlooking Cuaisin Caol. Doyle's Corner S Abseil down the crack on the north side to a stance just above the high-water mark. Climb steeply leftwards over a bulge to reach easier ground. Cuaisín Crack VD Start as for Doyles Corner. Climb the crack to the boss. Lone Sea Breakers S Start as for above. Climb diagonally right for 6m then move straight up to finish on the boss. The following climbs are all on the south-facing side of An Luidin and are accessed by abseiling down the face, following the line of the deep crack below the boss, or by back-climbing from the boss at about v.diff. Daly Bred S Abseil to the foot of the crack on the south face. Start 3m left of the crack below a ledge at a little over 2m. Gain the ledge and climb the wall near its right edge. Guys & Dolls VS 4c Climb the deep crack, which is steep and juggy. Blind Man HVS 5a Note - A storm has removed the nose mentioned on this route but it does not seem to have altered the grade. Start 2m right of Guys and Dolls and just left of a prominent triangular overhang with a flake crack on its left Climb steeply to a sloping ledge just right of a short nose. Move left around the nose and mantle the pulpit (crux). Step right and follow a groove running from right to left below a higher overhang. Climb directly to the top. Protection adequate. Plain Sailing HS 4b As for Blind Man as far as the sloping ledge. Move up and right to gain the foot of the flake crack. Follow this to the top. Cloudburst E1 5b Start immediately right of Plain Sailing, below a line of ledges. Climb directly up these until a large round hold can be reached (possible wire & friend). From here good holds can be reached up on the right. Reachy moves on good holds lead to good wires and the top. Water Slide VS 4b Start at the right end of this section of the S facing wall, 2m left of the left facing corner. Follow the groove from left to right . Poor Protection. Murphy's Lá VD Start right of Water Slide in a corner. Climb the corner, trending right to the foot of a higher corner capped by an overhang. Climb the right wall of this corner and move out right to finish. The next two climbs start about 12m to the right of Murphy's L?, at the right-hand end of the south facing wall. The most convenient approach to the foot of these two climbs is by abseil, down the crack below the chockstone. Pink Panther VD Start 2m left of January Sun in the right facing corner. Up the corner and over ledges to the foot of a flake crack. Climb this. January Sun S Start at the extreme right of the platform, at the bottom left of the wide crack with the chockstone.

This is the wall facing the north side of An Lúidín, from across the narrow cove of Cuasin Caol. The left-hand section of the wall is topped by a series of platforms, or wide ledges, many of which are littered with debris, while the right-hand end has a pair of fine corners, before petering out in a steep, narrow, boulder filled gully. Just opposite the tip of An Lúidín, there is a platform with some debris on its west side and a block sitting near the edge. An abseil stake has been put in place above this, between the embankment and the edge of the cliff. Abseil down onto the platform. Two pitons have been left insitu on the platform, from which a further abseil can be made (satisfy yourself that they are ok before using them) to a large sloping ledge about 6m above high water mark. The first two climbs start from here. (An alternative approach to these two climbs is to do the first pitch of Stampede). Note - the first three climbs finish up through an area with a lot of loose debris lying on ledges and great care is needed to avoid any stonefall Beetember HS 4a A fine start leads to a loose finish. Start from the large ledge, directly below the abseil point, just right of a step at the foot of a right facing corner. Climb the corner and continue over a slight bulge to reach a long ledge near its left end, below the wall with the quartz patches. Move a little right and carefully climb the wall to the abseil platform. Scramble carefully off. Caol Uisce HS 4b A fine start leads to a loose finish. Start at the foot of a long, right facing corner, reached by an airy step around from the right end of the large sloping ledge mentioned above. Climb the corner on good holds and trend carefully up left over two ledges to reach the platform with the pegs. Scramble carefully off. Stampede HS 4a Easy climbing leads to a loose finish. Low to half tide. Approach from Basecamp scramble down over easy rock and move west to the chockstone bridging the crack. Scramble down the edge of the slab to the boulders at the water's edge. Start just above and right of a huge red boulder, on a large, flat boulder below a wide crack. The crack runs up to the right end of a long ramp sloping up left. 1. VD Steep moves on big holds lead to easier climbing and the foot of the ramp. Follow this easily to a block belay 2m right of the first of two right facing corners. Pitch 2. 4a. Climb the corner, passing a steep section (crux), and step left at the jammed block. Move carefully left and climb a series of steps, trending left to reach the platform with the peg belays. Scramble off from here. Slí na Sláinte HVS 5a Protection is adequate and the interest is continuous. Start as for Stampede. Pitch 1, 5a. Climb the crack to where the angle eases just below the overhang. Traverse right on a footledge for 2m and pull over the bulge. Climb the left-trending crack to the top of the block and the steep corner above it. Several mantelshelves, one of which is difficult, lead to the foot of a second steep corner. Climb this to a wide, sloping, grassy ledge and move up to a sling and nut belay on a large flake. Pitch 2, VD Traverse right for 4m, step across right and climb the top of Sliabh Geal gCua to a metal spike belay just below the bank. Sliabh Geal gCua VS 4c Easier than it looks. Half-tide. Start 2m right of above, below the obvious long corner line. An overhanging start on good holds leads to some mantelshelves and a short, thin section, which is difficult to protect, before gaining the crack in the upper section. Straightforward lay-backing and bridging lead to a good incut ledge and the end of the difficulties. Continue easily up the corner and scramble up a short grassy section to a metal belay stake. (On the first ascent a peg was placed just above the incut ledge, with the intention of abseiling off, to avoid loose blocks above. The peg was too poor to be trusted, however, so an escape left was made. This upper section, which goes at about v. diff., was subsequently cleaned and climbed) Pinnacle Crack HS The pinnacle blocking the boulder filled gully to the right of Sliabh Geal gCua. It has a deep chimney on its right and two shorter corner cracks on its face. Start below the right facing corner crack on the face. Climb the corner to a spike belay, just below the top of the pinnacle. Abseil off (long sling needed). ==Basecampwall== Map M5. The slightly overhanging wall directly below the west side of Basecamp. A low arch, running east-west, pierces it. From Basecamp scramble down seaward on easy rock and move west to cross the narrow cleft onto An Lúidín just above a large chockstone. Move down the slab to the mouth of the arch for the next route. Stairway to Paradise HS 4b Start at the right side of the arch, at the foot of the obvious stepped ramp running up left. Follow the ramp to the top. Care needed with the rock April Airs VS 4b Start 4m right of Stairway to Paradise, below a slanting crack that starts 3m up the wall and runs up to a shoulder. Climb steeply to the crack, follow this to the shoulder and climb the short wall above. ==The Capstone== Map M6. It is worthwhile dropping down to Basecamp to get a fix on the position of the Capstone before approaching it. Cuasín Caol. A = Capstone. B = Beetember. C = Doyle's Corner. To reach the Capstone from Basecamp, return to the bank junction and continue west along the bank for about 45m, until directly above a large platform with a boulder sitting at its centre. Scramble down carefully (or abseil) to the platform and abseil from the boulder, directly to the Capstone for the Left Wall, or down the corner for the Right Wall. Capstone Left Wall. This is the first section of the Capstone area and is reached by scrambling down left (west) from the Capstone to gain the top of the ramp that runs down across the wall. Continue down to the foot of the ramp (one awkward section) and move up to reach a wide platform just right of Foilbeg, the zawn that marks the left or west edge of this area. The wall looks impressive but, on the central section, the quality deteriorates with height. West End Wall S Start 3m right of the edge. Follow a line, more or less direct, to the platform on top. (N.B. If tidal conditions rule out the traverse across from the Capstone, it is possible to abseil from this platform to the foot of the climb). Corn Flakes VS 4b From the right -hand end of the ramp, move 10m(?) left and climb an overhang which leads to a corner running from right to left. Good rock and good protection at the bottom of the corner leads to poor rock and poor protection above. Red Rocks HS Start near the top of the ramp, below and right of an obvious crack in the short, red headwall. Up steeply on good holds (no protection) to the foot of a slab. Gain the slab via a high step, move up and mantelshelf onto a ledge below the crack in the wall. Climb this or the shallow corner on the right. Capstone Lower Buttress. The next three routes are on the buttress directly below the Capstone and are reached by abseiling from the left (west) side of the Capstone down a corner to a barnacle-covered ledge just below the high water mark. Capstone Crack VD Climb the corner to the Capstone and continue to the platform above. Capstone left Corner VD Start about 3m right of Capstone Crack, below a short left facing corner with a crack. Climb the corner to a sloping ledge below a second corner. Steeply up this to the Capstone. Capstone right corner VD Start 2m right of Capstone Left Corner, below a short right facing corner. Climb the corner, move right and up to the Capstone. Capstone Right Wall Map M6. This wall is protected from westerly winds and, as a result, is often climbable when other areas are waveswept. The climbs are reached by abseiling down the corner to the east of the block on the platform or by scrambling down right (east) from The Capstone to the foot of the slab. Odhrán HVS 5a Start below the overhang at the foot of the slab and just right of a shallow cave. Climb the overhang for 4m, move right to good handhold and pull up on increasingly good holds to a large ledge. Move left and finish up the obvious corner.

This is the wall facing the north side of An Lúidín, from across the narrow cove of Cuasin Caol. The left-hand section of the wall is topped by a series of platforms, or wide ledges, many of which are littered with debris, while the right-hand end has a pair of fine corners, before petering out in a steep, narrow, boulder filled gully. Just opposite the tip of An Lúidín, there is a platform with some debris on its west side and a block sitting near the edge. An abseil stake has been put in place above this, between the embankment and the edge of the cliff. Abseil down onto the platform. Two pitons have been left insitu on the platform, from which a further abseil can be made (satisfy yourself that they are ok before using them) to a large sloping ledge about 6m above high water mark. The first two climbs start from here. (An alternative approach to these two climbs is to do the first pitch of Stampede). Note - the first three climbs finish up through an area with a lot of loose debris lying on ledges and great care is needed to avoid any stonefall Beetember HS 4a A fine start leads to a loose finish. Start from the large ledge, directly below the abseil point, just right of a step at the foot of a right facing corner. Climb the corner and continue over a slight bulge to reach a long ledge near its left end, below the wall with the quartz patches. Move a little right and carefully climb the wall to the abseil platform. Scramble carefully off. Caol Uisce HS 4b A fine start leads to a loose finish.

Climb the left-trending crack to the top of the block and the steep corner above it. Several mantelshelves, one of which is difficult, lead to the foot of a second steep corner. Climb this to a wide, sloping, grassy ledge and move up to a sling and nut belay on a large flake. Pitch 2, VD Traverse right for 4m, step across right and climb the top of Sliabh Geal gCua to a metal spike belay just below the bank. Sliabh Geal gCua VS 4c Easier than it looks. Half-tide. Start 2m right of above, below the obvious long corner line. An overhanging start on good holds leads to some mantelshelves and a short, thin section, which is difficult to protect, before gaining the crack in the upper section. Straightforward lay-backing and bridging lead to a good incut ledge and the end of the difficulties. Continue easily up the corner and scramble up a short grassy section to a metal belay stake. (On the first ascent a peg was placed just above the incut ledge, with the intention of abseiling off, to avoid loose blocks above. The peg was too poor to be trusted, however, so an escape left was made. This upper section, which goes at about v. diff., was subsequently cleaned and climbed) Pinnacle Crack HS The pinnacle blocking the boulder filled gully to the right of Sliabh Geal gCua. It has a deep chimney on its right and two shorter corner cracks on its face. Start below the right facing corner crack on the face. Climb the corner to a spike belay, just below the top of the pinnacle. Abseil off (long sling needed). ==Basecampwall== Map M5. The slightly overhanging wall directly below the west side of Basecamp.

This is the first section of the Capstone area and is reached by scrambling down left (west) from the Capstone to gain the top of the ramp that runs down across the wall. Continue down to the foot of the ramp (one awkward section) and move up to reach a wide platform just right of Foilbeg, the zawn that marks the left or west edge of this area. The wall looks impressive but, on the central section, the quality deteriorates with height. West End Wall S Start 3m right of the edge. Follow a line, more or less direct, to the platform on top. (N.B. If tidal conditions rule out the traverse across from the Capstone, it is possible to abseil from this platform to the foot of the climb). Corn Flakes VS 4b From the right -hand end of the ramp, move 10m(?) left and climb an overhang which leads to a corner running from right to left. Good rock and good protection at the bottom of the corner leads to poor rock and poor protection above.

An overhanging start on good holds leads to some mantelshelves and a short, thin section, which is difficult to protect, before gaining the crack in the upper section. Straightforward lay-backing and bridging lead to a good incut ledge and the end of the difficulties. Continue easily up the corner and scramble up a short grassy section to a metal belay stake. (On the first ascent a peg was placed just above the incut ledge, with the intention of abseiling off, to avoid loose blocks above. The peg was too poor to be trusted, however, so an escape left was made. This upper section, which goes at about v. diff., was subsequently cleaned and climbed) Pinnacle Crack HS The pinnacle blocking the boulder filled gully to the right of Sliabh Geal gCua. It has a deep chimney on its right and two shorter corner cracks on its face. Start below the right facing corner crack on the face. Climb the corner to a spike belay, just below the top of the pinnacle. Abseil off (long sling needed). ==Basecampwall== Map M5. The slightly overhanging wall directly below the west side of Basecamp.

It is worthwhile dropping down to Basecamp to get a fix on the position of the Capstone before approaching it. Cuasín Caol. A = Capstone. B = Beetember. C = Doyle's Corner. To reach the Capstone from Basecamp, return to the bank junction and continue west along the bank for about 45m, until directly above a large platform with a boulder sitting at its centre. Scramble down carefully (or abseil) to the platform and abseil from the boulder, directly to the Capstone for the Left Wall, or down the corner for the Right Wall. Capstone Left Wall. This is the first section of the Capstone area and is reached by scrambling down left (west) from the Capstone to gain the top of the ramp that runs down across the wall. Continue down to the foot of the ramp (one awkward section) and move up to reach a wide platform just right of Foilbeg, the zawn that marks the left or west edge of this area. The wall looks impressive but, on the central section, the quality deteriorates with height. West End Wall S Start 3m right of the edge. Follow a line, more or less direct, to the platform on top. (N.B. If tidal conditions rule out the traverse across from the Capstone, it is possible to abseil from this platform to the foot of the climb). Corn Flakes VS 4b From the right -hand end of the ramp, move 10m(?) left and climb an overhang which leads to a corner running from right to left. Good rock and good protection at the bottom of the corner leads to poor rock and poor protection above.

This is the wall facing the north side of An Lúidín, from across the narrow cove of Cuasin Caol. The left-hand section of the wall is topped by a series of platforms, or wide ledges, many of which are littered with debris, while the right-hand end has a pair of fine corners, before petering out in a steep, narrow, boulder filled gully. Just opposite the tip of An Lúidín, there is a platform with some debris on its west side and a block sitting near the edge. An abseil stake has been put in place above this, between the embankment and the edge of the cliff. Abseil down onto the platform. Two pitons have been left insitu on the platform, from which a further abseil can be made (satisfy yourself that they are ok before using them) to a large sloping ledge about 6m above high water mark.

Note - the first three climbs finish up through an area with a lot of loose debris lying on ledges and great care is needed to avoid any stonefall Beetember HS 4a A fine start leads to a loose finish. Start from the large ledge, directly below the abseil point, just right of a step at the foot of a right facing corner. Climb the corner and continue over a slight bulge to reach a long ledge near its left end, below the wall with the quartz patches. Move a little right and carefully climb the wall to the abseil platform. Scramble carefully off. Caol Uisce HS 4b A fine start leads to a loose finish.

Scramble off from here. Slí na Sláinte HVS 5a Protection is adequate and the interest is continuous. Start as for Stampede. Pitch 1, 5a. Climb the crack to where the angle eases just below the overhang. Traverse right on a footledge for 2m and pull over the bulge. Climb the left-trending crack to the top of the block and the steep corner above it. Several mantelshelves, one of which is difficult, lead to the foot of a second steep corner. Climb this to a wide, sloping, grassy ledge and move up to a sling and nut belay on a large flake. Pitch 2, VD Traverse right for 4m, step across right and climb the top of Sliabh Geal gCua to a metal spike belay just below the bank. Sliabh Geal gCua VS 4c Easier than it looks. Half-tide. Start 2m right of above, below the obvious long corner line. An overhanging start on good holds leads to some mantelshelves and a short, thin section, which is difficult to protect, before gaining the crack in the upper section. Straightforward lay-backing and bridging lead to a good incut ledge and the end of the difficulties. Continue easily up the corner and scramble up a short grassy section to a metal belay stake. (On the first ascent a peg was placed just above the incut ledge, with the intention of abseiling off, to avoid loose blocks above. The peg was too poor to be trusted, however, so an escape left was made. This upper section, which goes at about v. diff., was subsequently cleaned and climbed) Pinnacle Crack HS The pinnacle blocking the boulder filled gully to the right of Sliabh Geal gCua. It has a deep chimney on its right and two shorter corner cracks on its face. Start below the right facing corner crack on the face. Climb the corner to a spike belay, just below the top of the pinnacle. Abseil off (long sling needed). ==Basecampwall== Map M5. The slightly overhanging wall directly below the west side of Basecamp.

It is worthwhile dropping down to Basecamp to get a fix on the position of the Capstone before approaching it. Cuasín Caol. A = Capstone. B = Beetember. C = Doyle's Corner. To reach the Capstone from Basecamp, return to the bank junction and continue west along the bank for about 45m, until directly above a large platform with a boulder sitting at its centre. Scramble down carefully (or abseil) to the platform and abseil from the boulder, directly to the Capstone for the Left Wall, or down the corner for the Right Wall. Capstone Left Wall. This is the first section of the Capstone area and is reached by scrambling down left (west) from the Capstone to gain the top of the ramp that runs down across the wall. Continue down to the foot of the ramp (one awkward section) and move up to reach a wide platform just right of Foilbeg, the zawn that marks the left or west edge of this area. The wall looks impressive but, on the central section, the quality deteriorates with height. West End Wall S Start 3m right of the edge. Follow a line, more or less direct, to the platform on top. (N.B. If tidal conditions rule out the traverse across from the Capstone, it is possible to abseil from this platform to the foot of the climb). Corn Flakes VS 4b From the right -hand end of the ramp, move 10m(?) left and climb an overhang which leads to a corner running from right to left. Good rock and good protection at the bottom of the corner leads to poor rock and poor protection above. Red Rocks HS Start near the top of the ramp, below and right of an obvious crack in the short, red headwall. Up steeply on good holds (no protection) to the foot of a slab. Gain the slab via a high step, move up and mantelshelf onto a ledge below the crack in the wall. Climb this or the shallow corner on the right. Capstone Lower Buttress. The next three routes are on the buttress directly below the Capstone and are reached by abseiling from the left (west) side of the Capstone down a corner to a barnacle-covered ledge just below the high water mark. Capstone Crack VD Climb the corner to the Capstone and continue to the platform above. Capstone left Corner VD Start about 3m right of Capstone Crack, below a short left facing corner with a crack.

The left-hand section of the wall is topped by a series of platforms, or wide ledges, many of which are littered with debris, while the right-hand end has a pair of fine corners, before petering out in a steep, narrow, boulder filled gully. Just opposite the tip of An Lúidín, there is a platform with some debris on its west side and a block sitting near the edge. An abseil stake has been put in place above this, between the embankment and the edge of the cliff. Abseil down onto the platform. Two pitons have been left insitu on the platform, from which a further abseil can be made (satisfy yourself that they are ok before using them) to a large sloping ledge about 6m above high water mark. The first two climbs start from here. (An alternative approach to these two climbs is to do the first pitch of Stampede). Note - the first three climbs finish up through an area with a lot of loose debris lying on ledges and great care is needed to avoid any stonefall Beetember HS 4a A fine start leads to a loose finish. Start from the large ledge, directly below the abseil point, just right of a step at the foot of a right facing corner. Climb the corner and continue over a slight bulge to reach a long ledge near its left end, below the wall with the quartz patches. Move a little right and carefully climb the wall to the abseil platform. Scramble carefully off. Caol Uisce HS 4b A fine start leads to a loose finish. Start at the foot of a long, right facing corner, reached by an airy step around from the right end of the large sloping ledge mentioned above. Climb the corner on good holds and trend carefully up left over two ledges to reach the platform with the pegs. Scramble carefully off. Stampede HS 4a Easy climbing leads to a loose finish. Low to half tide. Approach from Basecamp scramble down over easy rock and move west to the chockstone bridging the crack. Scramble down the edge of the slab to the boulders at the water's edge. Start just above and right of a huge red boulder, on a large, flat boulder below a wide crack. The crack runs up to the right end of a long ramp sloping up left. 1. VD Steep moves on big holds lead to easier climbing and the foot of the ramp. Follow this easily to a block belay 2m right of the first of two right facing corners. Pitch 2. 4a. Climb the corner, passing a steep section (crux), and step left at the jammed block. Move carefully left and climb a series of steps, trending left to reach the platform with the peg belays. Scramble off from here. Slí na Sláinte HVS 5a Protection is adequate and the interest is continuous. Start as for Stampede. Pitch 1, 5a. Climb the crack to where the angle eases just below the overhang. Traverse right on a footledge for 2m and pull over the bulge. Climb the left-trending crack to the top of the block and the steep corner above it. Several mantelshelves, one of which is difficult, lead to the foot of a second steep corner. Climb this to a wide, sloping, grassy ledge and move up to a sling and nut belay on a large flake. Pitch 2, VD Traverse right for 4m, step across right and climb the top of Sliabh Geal gCua to a metal spike belay just below the bank. Sliabh Geal gCua VS 4c Easier than it looks. Half-tide. Start 2m right of above, below the obvious long corner line. An overhanging start on good holds leads to some mantelshelves and a short, thin section, which is difficult to protect, before gaining the crack in the upper section. Straightforward lay-backing and bridging lead to a good incut ledge and the end of the difficulties. Continue easily up the corner and scramble up a short grassy section to a metal belay stake. (On the first ascent a peg was placed just above the incut ledge, with the intention of abseiling off, to avoid loose blocks above. The peg was too poor to be trusted, however, so an escape left was made. This upper section, which goes at about v. diff., was subsequently cleaned and climbed) Pinnacle Crack HS The pinnacle blocking the boulder filled gully to the right of Sliabh Geal gCua. It has a deep chimney on its right and two shorter corner cracks on its face. Start below the right facing corner crack on the face. Climb the corner to a spike belay, just below the top of the pinnacle. Abseil off (long sling needed). ==Basecampwall== Map M5. The slightly overhanging wall directly below the west side of Basecamp. A low arch, running east-west, pierces it. From Basecamp scramble down seaward on easy rock and move west to cross the narrow cleft onto An Lúidín just above a large chockstone. Move down the slab to the mouth of the arch for the next route. Stairway to Paradise HS 4b Start at the right side of the arch, at the foot of the obvious stepped ramp running up left. Follow the ramp to the top. Care needed with the rock April Airs VS 4b Start 4m right of Stairway to Paradise, below a slanting crack that starts 3m up the wall and runs up to a shoulder. Climb steeply to the crack, follow this to the shoulder and climb the short wall above. ==The Capstone== Map M6. It is worthwhile dropping down to Basecamp to get a fix on the position of the Capstone before approaching it. Cuasín Caol. A = Capstone. B = Beetember. C = Doyle's Corner. To reach the Capstone from Basecamp, return to the bank junction and continue west along the bank for about 45m, until directly above a large platform with a boulder sitting at its centre. Scramble down carefully (or abseil) to the platform and abseil from the boulder, directly to the Capstone for the Left Wall, or down the corner for the Right Wall. Capstone Left Wall. This is the first section of the Capstone area and is reached by scrambling down left (west) from the Capstone to gain the top of the ramp that runs down across the wall. Continue down to the foot of the ramp (one awkward section) and move up to reach a wide platform just right of Foilbeg, the zawn that marks the left or west edge of this area. The wall looks impressive but, on the central section, the quality deteriorates with height. West End Wall S Start 3m right of the edge. Follow a line, more or less direct, to the platform on top. (N.B. If tidal conditions rule out the traverse across from the Capstone, it is possible to abseil from this platform to the foot of the climb). Corn Flakes VS 4b From the right -hand end of the ramp, move 10m(?) left and climb an overhang which leads to a corner running from right to left. Good rock and good protection at the bottom of the corner leads to poor rock and poor protection above. Red Rocks HS Start near the top of the ramp, below and right of an obvious crack in the short, red headwall. Up steeply on good holds (no protection) to the foot of a slab. Gain the slab via a high step, move up and mantelshelf onto a ledge below the crack in the wall. Climb this or the shallow corner on the right. Capstone Lower Buttress. The next three routes are on the buttress directly below the Capstone and are reached by abseiling from the left (west) side of the Capstone down a corner to a barnacle-covered ledge just below the high water mark. Capstone Crack VD Climb the corner to the Capstone and continue to the platform above. Capstone left Corner VD Start about 3m right of Capstone Crack, below a short left facing corner with a crack. Climb the corner to a sloping ledge below a second corner. Steeply up this to the Capstone. Capstone right corner VD Start 2m right of Capstone Left Corner, below a short right facing corner. Climb the corner, move right and up to the Capstone. Capstone Right Wall Map M6. This wall is protected from westerly winds and, as a result, is often climbable when other areas are waveswept. The climbs are reached by abseiling down the corner to the east of the block on the platform or by scrambling down right (east) from The Capstone to the foot of the slab. Odhrán HVS 5a Start below the overhang at the foot of the slab and just right of a shallow cave. Climb the overhang for 4m, move right to good handhold and pull up on increasingly good holds to a large ledge. Move left and finish up the obvious corner. Cú Uladh S Start at the left end of the ledge system, on a ledge on the high-water mark, or a higher ledge if the tide is in, below a short, narrow corner, formed by a flake, near the top of the crag. Climb up and enter the corner which leads to the platform, just right of Odhrán. The Music Makers S Start 3m right of Cú Uladh, below and just right of the right-facing open-book corner. Climb, trending left, to the foot of the corner. Follow the left edge of the slab in an airy position. A little help from my friends HVS 5a A poorly protected finish. Start as for Music Makers, below and left of protruding V-shaped block. Climb left-hand side of block to large ledge and clean left facing corner. Climb the corner (crux)to reach the right hand end of the large platform. Sacralicious HVS 5a Start just right of A little Help From My Friends. Climb a corner to a large ledge. Step left and climb the right side of the large protruding block. From the top of the block move right to a small ledge then up and back left to finish. Small friends for protection. Dúlamán VS 5a Start to the right of Sacralicious, below a short corner. Climb the corner to the large sloping ledge. Make a difficult move to gain the small ledge below a crack sloping up left. Climb the crack to a stake belay. Well protected. Tracy VS4c Start below the right end of the wide sloping ledge, behind the squat sea stack (Tuar). Climb to the sloping ledge. Move 2m left to a small niche. Up and back right on small holds to finish on a ledge (avoid loose rock slightly to left of top section). add comment The headland between Foilbeg and Foilmore has some steep rock, but there appears to be a horizontal band of bad rock running across the upper section. ==Foilnadilisk Head== Map M1, M7. This area is demarcated on the left (west), by a narrow zawn, Foilnadilisk and on the right (east), by a smaller zawn, Foileen. Approach. As for Basecamp as far as the junction of the earthen banks. Move up along the bank and follow a higher bank and fence west above the cliffs for a further 150m, passing two zawns to reach the headland between Foileen and Foilnadilisk. Scramble down over rough, steep ground to a wide ledge with a pile of blocks. Abseil from the blocks to the foot of the wall. From the base of the wall move west for about 150m, scramble around back of small zawn, then down to platform at sea level (a small inlet bisects this). The crag is on the left, an obvious clean face, while the arete is immediately to the right, practically at the end of the inlet. All the climbs are short, but worthwhile Beta Blockers HS Start below a strange block formation near the left end of the wall. Climb up through the blocks to top.

Rob HVS 5a Start a little right of Blasphemiss, on flat slab below point of nose. Move up to ledge under overhang, veer left and straight up. Foiled Again HS Start just right of Rob, below the short pod. Dicult moves to enter the pod are followed by easier climbing. The following three climbs are located on the wall below the abseil blocks. Little Jack HS Start just left of the blocks below a faint crack. Climb the crack. Only Up. HS Start 2m right of Little Jack, below obvious crack, which is followed to the top. Dun Coffin VS 4c Start 3m right of Only Up. Follow flaked crack straight to top."

To reach the Capstone from Basecamp, return to the bank junction and continue west along the bank for about 45m, until directly above a large platform with a boulder sitting at its centre. Scramble down carefully (or abseil) to the platform and abseil from the boulder, directly to the Capstone for the Left Wall, or down the corner for the Right Wall. Capstone Left Wall. This is the first section of the Capstone area and is reached by scrambling down left (west) from the Capstone to gain the top of the ramp that runs down across the wall. Continue down to the foot of the ramp (one awkward section) and move up to reach a wide platform just right of Foilbeg, the zawn that marks the left or west edge of this area. The wall looks impressive but, on the central section, the quality deteriorates with height. West End Wall S Start 3m right of the edge. Follow a line, more or less direct, to the platform on top. (N.B. If tidal conditions rule out the traverse across from the Capstone, it is possible to abseil from this platform to the foot of the climb). Corn Flakes VS 4b From the right -hand end of the ramp, move 10m(?) left and climb an overhang which leads to a corner running from right to left. Good rock and good protection at the bottom of the corner leads to poor rock and poor protection above. Red Rocks HS Start near the top of the ramp, below and right of an obvious crack in the short, red headwall. Up steeply on good holds (no protection) to the foot of a slab. Gain the slab via a high step, move up and mantelshelf onto a ledge below the crack in the wall. Climb this or the shallow corner on the right. Capstone Lower Buttress.

This is the wall facing the north side of An Lúidín, from across the narrow cove of Cuasin Caol. The left-hand section of the wall is topped by a series of platforms, or wide ledges, many of which are littered with debris, while the right-hand end has a pair of fine corners, before petering out in a steep, narrow, boulder filled gully. Just opposite the tip of An Lúidín, there is a platform with some debris on its west side and a block sitting near the edge. An abseil stake has been put in place above this, between the embankment and the edge of the cliff. Abseil down onto the platform. Two pitons have been left insitu on the platform, from which a further abseil can be made (satisfy yourself that they are ok before using them) to a large sloping ledge about 6m above high water mark. The first two climbs start from here. (An alternative approach to these two climbs is to do the first pitch of Stampede). Note - the first three climbs finish up through an area with a lot of loose debris lying on ledges and great care is needed to avoid any stonefall Beetember HS 4a A fine start leads to a loose finish. Start from the large ledge, directly below the abseil point, just right of a step at the foot of a right facing corner. Climb the corner and continue over a slight bulge to reach a long ledge near its left end, below the wall with the quartz patches. Move a little right and carefully climb the wall to the abseil platform. Scramble carefully off. Caol Uisce HS 4b A fine start leads to a loose finish.

Pitch 2, VD Traverse right for 4m, step across right and climb the top of Sliabh Geal gCua to a metal spike belay just below the bank. Sliabh Geal gCua VS 4c Easier than it looks. Half-tide. Start 2m right of above, below the obvious long corner line. An overhanging start on good holds leads to some mantelshelves and a short, thin section, which is difficult to protect, before gaining the crack in the upper section. Straightforward lay-backing and bridging lead to a good incut ledge and the end of the difficulties. Continue easily up the corner and scramble up a short grassy section to a metal belay stake. (On the first ascent a peg was placed just above the incut ledge, with the intention of abseiling off, to avoid loose blocks above. The peg was too poor to be trusted, however, so an escape left was made. This upper section, which goes at about v. diff., was subsequently cleaned and climbed) Pinnacle Crack HS The pinnacle blocking the boulder filled gully to the right of Sliabh Geal gCua. It has a deep chimney on its right and two shorter corner cracks on its face. Start below the right facing corner crack on the face.

            "description": "Hop across the channel to the right edge of the wide crack below the chockstone. Climb the edge. ==Cuaisín Caol Wall== (Map M5). This is the wall facing the north side of An Lúidín, from across the narrow cove of Cuasin Caol. The left-hand section of the wall is topped by a series of platforms, or wide ledges, many of which are littered with debris, while the right-hand end has a pair of fine corners, before petering out in a steep, narrow, boulder filled gully. Just opposite the tip of An Lúidín, there is a platform with some debris on its west side and a block sitting near the edge. An abseil stake has been put in place above this, between the embankment and the edge of the cliff. Abseil down onto the platform. Two pitons have been left insitu on the platform, from which a further abseil can be made (satisfy yourself that they are ok before using them) to a large sloping ledge about 6m above high water mark. The first two climbs start from here. (An alternative approach to these two climbs is to do the first pitch of Stampede). Note - the first three climbs finish up through an area with a lot of loose debris lying on ledges and great care is needed to avoid any stonefall Beetember HS 4a A fine start leads to a loose finish. Start from the large ledge, directly below the abseil point, just right of a step at the foot of a right facing corner. Climb the corner and continue over a slight bulge to reach a long ledge near its left end, below the wall with the quartz patches. Move a little right and carefully climb the wall to the abseil platform. Scramble carefully off. Caol Uisce HS 4b A fine start leads to a loose finish. Start at the foot of a long, right facing corner, reached by an airy step around from the right end of the large sloping ledge mentioned above. Climb the corner on good holds and trend carefully up left over two ledges to reach the platform with the pegs. Scramble carefully off. Stampede HS 4a Easy climbing leads to a loose finish. Low to half tide. Approach from Basecamp scramble down over easy rock and move west to the chockstone bridging the crack. Scramble down the edge of the slab to the boulders at the water's edge. Start just above and right of a huge red boulder, on a large, flat boulder below a wide crack. The crack runs up to the right end of a long ramp sloping up left. 1. VD Steep moves on big holds lead to easier climbing and the foot of the ramp. Follow this easily to a block belay 2m right of the first of two right facing corners. Pitch 2. 4a. Climb the corner, passing a steep section (crux), and step left at the jammed block. Move carefully left and climb a series of steps, trending left to reach the platform with the peg belays. Scramble off from here. Slí na Sláinte HVS 5a Protection is adequate and the interest is continuous. Start as for Stampede. Pitch 1, 5a. Climb the crack to where the angle eases just below the overhang. Traverse right on a footledge for 2m and pull over the bulge. Climb the left-trending crack to the top of the block and the steep corner above it. Several mantelshelves, one of which is difficult, lead to the foot of a second steep corner. Climb this to a wide, sloping, grassy ledge and move up to a sling and nut belay on a large flake. Pitch 2, VD Traverse right for 4m, step across right and climb the top of Sliabh Geal gCua to a metal spike belay just below the bank. Sliabh Geal gCua VS 4c Easier than it looks. Half-tide. Start 2m right of above, below the obvious long corner line. An overhanging start on good holds leads to some mantelshelves and a short, thin section, which is difficult to protect, before gaining the crack in the upper section. Straightforward lay-backing and bridging lead to a good incut ledge and the end of the difficulties. Continue easily up the corner and scramble up a short grassy section to a metal belay stake. (On the first ascent a peg was placed just above the incut ledge, with the intention of abseiling off, to avoid loose blocks above. The peg was too poor to be trusted, however, so an escape left was made. This upper section, which goes at about v. diff., was subsequently cleaned and climbed) Pinnacle Crack HS The pinnacle blocking the boulder filled gully to the right of Sliabh Geal gCua. It has a deep chimney on its right and two shorter corner cracks on its face. Start below the right facing corner crack on the face. Climb the corner to a spike belay, just below the top of the pinnacle. Abseil off (long sling needed). ==Basecampwall== Map M5. The slightly overhanging wall directly below the west side of Basecamp. A low arch, running east-west, pierces it. From Basecamp scramble down seaward on easy rock and move west to cross the narrow cleft onto An Lúidín just above a large chockstone. Move down the slab to the mouth of the arch for the next route. Stairway to Paradise HS 4b Start at the right side of the arch, at the foot of the obvious stepped ramp running up left. Follow the ramp to the top. Care needed with the rock April Airs VS 4b Start 4m right of Stairway to Paradise, below a slanting crack that starts 3m up the wall and runs up to a shoulder. Climb steeply to the crack, follow this to the shoulder and climb the short wall above. ==The Capstone== Map M6. It is worthwhile dropping down to Basecamp to get a fix on the position of the Capstone before approaching it. Cuasín Caol. A = Capstone. B = Beetember. C = Doyle's Corner. To reach the Capstone from Basecamp, return to the bank junction and continue west along the bank for about 45m, until directly above a large platform with a boulder sitting at its centre. Scramble down carefully (or abseil) to the platform and abseil from the boulder, directly to the Capstone for the Left Wall, or down the corner for the Right Wall. Capstone Left Wall. This is the first section of the Capstone area and is reached by scrambling down left (west) from the Capstone to gain the top of the ramp that runs down across the wall. Continue down to the foot of the ramp (one awkward section) and move up to reach a wide platform just right of Foilbeg, the zawn that marks the left or west edge of this area. The wall looks impressive but, on the central section, the quality deteriorates with height. West End Wall S Start 3m right of the edge. Follow a line, more or less direct, to the platform on top. (N.B. If tidal conditions rule out the traverse across from the Capstone, it is possible to abseil from this platform to the foot of the climb). Corn Flakes VS 4b From the right -hand end of the ramp, move 10m(?) left and climb an overhang which leads to a corner running from right to left. Good rock and good protection at the bottom of the corner leads to poor rock and poor protection above. Red Rocks HS Start near the top of the ramp, below and right of an obvious crack in the short, red headwall. Up steeply on good holds (no protection) to the foot of a slab. Gain the slab via a high step, move up and mantelshelf onto a ledge below the crack in the wall. Climb this or the shallow corner on the right. Capstone Lower Buttress. The next three routes are on the buttress directly below the Capstone and are reached by abseiling from the left (west) side of the Capstone down a corner to a barnacle-covered ledge just below the high water mark. Capstone Crack VD Climb the corner to the Capstone and continue to the platform above. Capstone left Corner VD Start about 3m right of Capstone Crack, below a short left facing corner with a crack. Climb the corner to a sloping ledge below a second corner. Steeply up this to the Capstone. Capstone right corner VD Start 2m right of Capstone Left Corner, below a short right facing corner. Climb the corner, move right and up to the Capstone. Capstone Right Wall Map M6. This wall is protected from westerly winds and, as a result, is often climbable when other areas are waveswept. The climbs are reached by abseiling down the corner to the east of the block on the platform or by scrambling down right (east) from The Capstone to the foot of the slab. Odhrán HVS 5a Start below the overhang at the foot of the slab and just right of a shallow cave. Climb the overhang for 4m, move right to good handhold and pull up on increasingly good holds to a large ledge. Move left and finish up the obvious corner. Cú Uladh S Start at the left end of the ledge system, on a ledge on the high-water mark, or a higher ledge if the tide is in, below a short, narrow corner, formed by a flake, near the top of the crag. Climb up and enter the corner which leads to the platform, just right of Odhrán. The Music Makers S Start 3m right of Cú Uladh, below and just right of the right-facing open-book corner. Climb, trending left, to the foot of the corner. Follow the left edge of the slab in an airy position. A little help from my friends HVS 5a A poorly protected finish. Start as for Music Makers, below and left of protruding V-shaped block. Climb left-hand side of block to large ledge and clean left facing corner. Climb the corner (crux)to reach the right hand end of the large platform. Sacralicious HVS 5a Start just right of A little Help From My Friends. Climb a corner to a large ledge. Step left and climb the right side of the large protruding block. From the top of the block move right to a small ledge then up and back left to finish. Small friends for protection. Dúlamán VS 5a Start to the right of Sacralicious, below a short corner. Climb the corner to the large sloping ledge. Make a difficult move to gain the small ledge below a crack sloping up left. Climb the crack to a stake belay. Well protected. Tracy VS4c Start below the right end of the wide sloping ledge, behind the squat sea stack (Tuar). Climb to the sloping ledge. Move 2m left to a small niche. Up and back right on small holds to finish on a ledge (avoid loose rock slightly to left of top section). add comment The headland between Foilbeg and Foilmore has some steep rock, but there appears to be a horizontal band of bad rock running across the upper section. ==Foilnadilisk Head== Map M1, M7. This area is demarcated on the left (west), by a narrow zawn, Foilnadilisk and on the right (east), by a smaller zawn, Foileen. Approach. As for Basecamp as far as the junction of the earthen banks. Move up along the bank and follow a higher bank and fence west above the cliffs for a further 150m, passing two zawns to reach the headland between Foileen and Foilnadilisk. Scramble down over rough, steep ground to a wide ledge with a pile of blocks. Abseil from the blocks to the foot of the wall. From the base of the wall move west for about 150m, scramble around back of small zawn, then down to platform at sea level (a small inlet bisects this). The crag is on the left, an obvious clean face, while the arete is immediately to the right, practically at the end of the inlet. All the climbs are short, but worthwhile Beta Blockers HS Start below a strange block formation near the left end of the wall. Climb up through the blocks to top. Fault Line VS 4b Start 2m right of above. Climb the obvious line. Large Triangle. VS 4b. Start 2m right of above. Climb through large triangular niche to top. Foilin In Love Again VS 4c Start 3m right of Large Triangle. Climb thin parallel cracks through small triangular niche and with difficulty gain large jug in popcorn crack. Continue to top. Blasphemiss HS 4b Start at the foot of the obvious left slanting chimney/groove at the head of the inlet. Struggle up this as best you can. Rob HVS 5a Start a little right of Blasphemiss, on flat slab below point of nose. Move up to ledge under overhang, veer left and straight up. Foiled Again HS Start just right of Rob, below the short pod. Dicult moves to enter the pod are followed by easier climbing. The following three climbs are located on the wall below the abseil blocks. Little Jack HS Start just left of the blocks below a faint crack. Climb the crack. Only Up. HS Start 2m right of Little Jack, below obvious crack, which is followed to the top. Dun Coffin VS 4c Start 3m right of Only Up. Follow flaked crack straight to top."

Start from the large ledge, directly below the abseil point, just right of a step at the foot of a right facing corner. Climb the corner and continue over a slight bulge to reach a long ledge near its left end, below the wall with the quartz patches. Move a little right and carefully climb the wall to the abseil platform. Scramble carefully off. Caol Uisce HS 4b A fine start leads to a loose finish. Start at the foot of a long, right facing corner, reached by an airy step around from the right end of the large sloping ledge mentioned above. Climb the corner on good holds and trend carefully up left over two ledges to reach the platform with the pegs. Scramble carefully off. Stampede HS 4a Easy climbing leads to a loose finish. Low to half tide. Approach from Basecamp scramble down over easy rock and move west to the chockstone bridging the crack. Scramble down the edge of the slab to the boulders at the water's edge. Start just above and right of a huge red boulder, on a large, flat boulder below a wide crack. The crack runs up to the right end of a long ramp sloping up left. 1. VD Steep moves on big holds lead to easier climbing and the foot of the ramp. Follow this easily to a block belay 2m right of the first of two right facing corners. Pitch 2. 4a. Climb the corner, passing a steep section (crux), and step left at the jammed block. Move carefully left and climb a series of steps, trending left to reach the platform with the peg belays. Scramble off from here. Slí na Sláinte HVS 5a Protection is adequate and the interest is continuous. Start as for Stampede. Pitch 1, 5a. Climb the crack to where the angle eases just below the overhang. Traverse right on a footledge for 2m and pull over the bulge. Climb the left-trending crack to the top of the block and the steep corner above it. Several mantelshelves, one of which is difficult, lead to the foot of a second steep corner. Climb this to a wide, sloping, grassy ledge and move up to a sling and nut belay on a large flake. Pitch 2, VD Traverse right for 4m, step across right and climb the top of Sliabh Geal gCua to a metal spike belay just below the bank. Sliabh Geal gCua VS 4c Easier than it looks. Half-tide. Start 2m right of above, below the obvious long corner line. An overhanging start on good holds leads to some mantelshelves and a short, thin section, which is difficult to protect, before gaining the crack in the upper section. Straightforward lay-backing and bridging lead to a good incut ledge and the end of the difficulties. Continue easily up the corner and scramble up a short grassy section to a metal belay stake. (On the first ascent a peg was placed just above the incut ledge, with the intention of abseiling off, to avoid loose blocks above. The peg was too poor to be trusted, however, so an escape left was made. This upper section, which goes at about v. diff., was subsequently cleaned and climbed) Pinnacle Crack HS The pinnacle blocking the boulder filled gully to the right of Sliabh Geal gCua. It has a deep chimney on its right and two shorter corner cracks on its face. Start below the right facing corner crack on the face. Climb the corner to a spike belay, just below the top of the pinnacle. Abseil off (long sling needed). ==Basecampwall== Map M5. The slightly overhanging wall directly below the west side of Basecamp. A low arch, running east-west, pierces it. From Basecamp scramble down seaward on easy rock and move west to cross the narrow cleft onto An Lúidín just above a large chockstone. Move down the slab to the mouth of the arch for the next route. Stairway to Paradise HS 4b Start at the right side of the arch, at the foot of the obvious stepped ramp running up left. Follow the ramp to the top. Care needed with the rock April Airs VS 4b Start 4m right of Stairway to Paradise, below a slanting crack that starts 3m up the wall and runs up to a shoulder. Climb steeply to the crack, follow this to the shoulder and climb the short wall above. ==The Capstone== Map M6. It is worthwhile dropping down to Basecamp to get a fix on the position of the Capstone before approaching it. Cuasín Caol. A = Capstone. B = Beetember. C = Doyle's Corner. To reach the Capstone from Basecamp, return to the bank junction and continue west along the bank for about 45m, until directly above a large platform with a boulder sitting at its centre. Scramble down carefully (or abseil) to the platform and abseil from the boulder, directly to the Capstone for the Left Wall, or down the corner for the Right Wall. Capstone Left Wall. This is the first section of the Capstone area and is reached by scrambling down left (west) from the Capstone to gain the top of the ramp that runs down across the wall. Continue down to the foot of the ramp (one awkward section) and move up to reach a wide platform just right of Foilbeg, the zawn that marks the left or west edge of this area. The wall looks impressive but, on the central section, the quality deteriorates with height. West End Wall S Start 3m right of the edge. Follow a line, more or less direct, to the platform on top. (N.B. If tidal conditions rule out the traverse across from the Capstone, it is possible to abseil from this platform to the foot of the climb). Corn Flakes VS 4b From the right -hand end of the ramp, move 10m(?) left and climb an overhang which leads to a corner running from right to left. Good rock and good protection at the bottom of the corner leads to poor rock and poor protection above. Red Rocks HS Start near the top of the ramp, below and right of an obvious crack in the short, red headwall. Up steeply on good holds (no protection) to the foot of a slab. Gain the slab via a high step, move up and mantelshelf onto a ledge below the crack in the wall. Climb this or the shallow corner on the right. Capstone Lower Buttress. The next three routes are on the buttress directly below the Capstone and are reached by abseiling from the left (west) side of the Capstone down a corner to a barnacle-covered ledge just below the high water mark. Capstone Crack VD Climb the corner to the Capstone and continue to the platform above. Capstone left Corner VD Start about 3m right of Capstone Crack, below a short left facing corner with a crack. Climb the corner to a sloping ledge below a second corner. Steeply up this to the Capstone. Capstone right corner VD Start 2m right of Capstone Left Corner, below a short right facing corner. Climb the corner, move right and up to the Capstone. Capstone Right Wall Map M6. This wall is protected from westerly winds and, as a result, is often climbable when other areas are waveswept. The climbs are reached by abseiling down the corner to the east of the block on the platform or by scrambling down right (east) from The Capstone to the foot of the slab.

            "description": "Start at the right side of the arch, at the foot of the obvious stepped ramp running up left. Follow the ramp to the top. Care needed with the rock April Airs VS 4b Start 4m right of Stairway to Paradise, below a slanting crack that starts 3m up the wall and runs up to a shoulder. Climb steeply to the crack, follow this to the shoulder and climb the short wall above. ==The Capstone== Map M6. It is worthwhile dropping down to Basecamp to get a fix on the position of the Capstone before approaching it. Cuasín Caol. A = Capstone. B = Beetember. C = Doyle's Corner. To reach the Capstone from Basecamp, return to the bank junction and continue west along the bank for about 45m, until directly above a large platform with a boulder sitting at its centre. Scramble down carefully (or abseil) to the platform and abseil from the boulder, directly to the Capstone for the Left Wall, or down the corner for the Right Wall. Capstone Left Wall. This is the first section of the Capstone area and is reached by scrambling down left (west) from the Capstone to gain the top of the ramp that runs down across the wall. Continue down to the foot of the ramp (one awkward section) and move up to reach a wide platform just right of Foilbeg, the zawn that marks the left or west edge of this area. The wall looks impressive but, on the central section, the quality deteriorates with height. West End Wall S Start 3m right of the edge. Follow a line, more or less direct, to the platform on top. (N.B. If tidal conditions rule out the traverse across from the Capstone, it is possible to abseil from this platform to the foot of the climb). Corn Flakes VS 4b From the right -hand end of the ramp, move 10m(?) left and climb an overhang which leads to a corner running from right to left. Good rock and good protection at the bottom of the corner leads to poor rock and poor protection above. Red Rocks HS Start near the top of the ramp, below and right of an obvious crack in the short, red headwall. Up steeply on good holds (no protection) to the foot of a slab. Gain the slab via a high step, move up and mantelshelf onto a ledge below the crack in the wall. Climb this or the shallow corner on the right. Capstone Lower Buttress. The next three routes are on the buttress directly below the Capstone and are reached by abseiling from the left (west) side of the Capstone down a corner to a barnacle-covered ledge just below the high water mark. Capstone Crack VD Climb the corner to the Capstone and continue to the platform above. Capstone left Corner VD Start about 3m right of Capstone Crack, below a short left facing corner with a crack. Climb the corner to a sloping ledge below a second corner. Steeply up this to the Capstone. Capstone right corner VD Start 2m right of Capstone Left Corner, below a short right facing corner. Climb the corner, move right and up to the Capstone. Capstone Right Wall Map M6. This wall is protected from westerly winds and, as a result, is often climbable when other areas are waveswept. The climbs are reached by abseiling down the corner to the east of the block on the platform or by scrambling down right (east) from The Capstone to the foot of the slab. Odhrán HVS 5a Start below the overhang at the foot of the slab and just right of a shallow cave. Climb the overhang for 4m, move right to good handhold and pull up on increasingly good holds to a large ledge. Move left and finish up the obvious corner. Cú Uladh S Start at the left end of the ledge system, on a ledge on the high-water mark, or a higher ledge if the tide is in, below a short, narrow corner, formed by a flake, near the top of the crag. Climb up and enter the corner which leads to the platform, just right of Odhrán. The Music Makers S Start 3m right of Cú Uladh, below and just right of the right-facing open-book corner. Climb, trending left, to the foot of the corner. Follow the left edge of the slab in an airy position. A little help from my friends HVS 5a A poorly protected finish. Start as for Music Makers, below and left of protruding V-shaped block. Climb left-hand side of block to large ledge and clean left facing corner. Climb the corner (crux)to reach the right hand end of the large platform. Sacralicious HVS 5a Start just right of A little Help From My Friends. Climb a corner to a large ledge. Step left and climb the right side of the large protruding block. From the top of the block move right to a small ledge then up and back left to finish. Small friends for protection. Dúlamán VS 5a Start to the right of Sacralicious, below a short corner. Climb the corner to the large sloping ledge. Make a difficult move to gain the small ledge below a crack sloping up left. Climb the crack to a stake belay. Well protected. Tracy VS4c Start below the right end of the wide sloping ledge, behind the squat sea stack (Tuar). Climb to the sloping ledge. Move 2m left to a small niche. Up and back right on small holds to finish on a ledge (avoid loose rock slightly to left of top section). add comment The headland between Foilbeg and Foilmore has some steep rock, but there appears to be a horizontal band of bad rock running across the upper section. ==Foilnadilisk Head== Map M1, M7. This area is demarcated on the left (west), by a narrow zawn, Foilnadilisk and on the right (east), by a smaller zawn, Foileen. Approach. As for Basecamp as far as the junction of the earthen banks. Move up along the bank and follow a higher bank and fence west above the cliffs for a further 150m, passing two zawns to reach the headland between Foileen and Foilnadilisk. Scramble down over rough, steep ground to a wide ledge with a pile of blocks. Abseil from the blocks to the foot of the wall. From the base of the wall move west for about 150m, scramble around back of small zawn, then down to platform at sea level (a small inlet bisects this). The crag is on the left, an obvious clean face, while the arete is immediately to the right, practically at the end of the inlet. All the climbs are short, but worthwhile Beta Blockers HS Start below a strange block formation near the left end of the wall. Climb up through the blocks to top. Fault Line VS 4b Start 2m right of above. Climb the obvious line. Large Triangle. VS 4b. Start 2m right of above. Climb through large triangular niche to top. Foilin In Love Again VS 4c Start 3m right of Large Triangle. Climb thin parallel cracks through small triangular niche and with difficulty gain large jug in popcorn crack. Continue to top. Blasphemiss HS 4b Start at the foot of the obvious left slanting chimney/groove at the head of the inlet. Struggle up this as best you can. Rob HVS 5a Start a little right of Blasphemiss, on flat slab below point of nose. Move up to ledge under overhang, veer left and straight up. Foiled Again HS Start just right of Rob, below the short pod. Dicult moves to enter the pod are followed by easier climbing. The following three climbs are located on the wall below the abseil blocks. Little Jack HS Start just left of the blocks below a faint crack. Climb the crack. Only Up. HS Start 2m right of Little Jack, below obvious crack, which is followed to the top. Dun Coffin VS 4c Start 3m right of Only Up. Follow flaked crack straight to top."

Follow this to belay ledge. 2. 15m. As for Shak or else clamber right over holly bush into circular 'room' and climb the back of this to the stairway to the first ledge and abseil. SKILLIGOLEE 30m E1 5a Start at same point as Greeted by Ants. The route goes to the left of the little overhang at 3m, following a thin crack towards the left-slanting overhang at half-height. On the way to this, there is a faint bulge; getting past this feels slightly committing as the crack disappears above and the next apparent protection is at the overhang. However, some small wire placements can be found. Above the overhang is easier climbing along the left side of a large flake. SHAK 45m VS 4c Located near the right end of the SW facing wall of the cliff. Start in a East facing groove approx. 5m from the corner. (1). 30m. Climb the groove to the top, then break right onto the wall, climbing steeply to a large belay ledge. (2). 15m. Climb easily but without protection on large holds to the top. THUNDER ON THE MOUNTAIN 50m VS 4c,4c Left of Shak, at right hand end of upper narrow ledge [above larger main ledge]. 1. 35m Climb detached block to base of left-facing crack. Up this to right-facing flake crack. A detached block on the ledge above forms an overhang but this presents no obstacle. Belay on ledge. 2. 15m Climb the obvious crack to slabby section and follow groove at left to top. THE WILD SIDE 35m HVS 5a Start up left-facing crack as for Thunder on the Mountain but instead of going left, go right along grassy ledge to corner. Up this past small overhang and clean slab to ledge, Exit onto either 'Thunder' ledge on left or Shak ledge on right BLACK OUT 55m E2 5b 5b 5a Start approx. 5m left of Thunder on the Mountain. Pitch 1 25m 5b Ascend creaky flakes to left-slanting shallow corner and follow this to harder exit left to belay ledge at holly tree. Pitch 2 12m 5b Climb crack and slab in exposed position with minimal protection to next belay. Pitch 3 15m 5a To top. H Hennessy, T Krol 17/3/09 onsight. From higher up the gully Getting back down from these climbs is quite complex and a little bit magical. Head down the most southerly of the east facing part of the cliff. Keep right [looking out] and down-climb easy rock onto a ledge above a hole in the terrace below. The left end of this ledge leads to the terrace. Pass the aforementioned hole [which can be taken but involves a drop at the bottom] and descend the amazing little gully beyond which twists around and down to a second lower terrace. Head north on the terrace to the abseil point above Piper's Groove. THE OLD RUGGED CROSS 65m E2 5b, 5b, 5a This follows the sharp-edged left-facing flake crack that starts at 5m and continues to belay at holly tree [shared belay with 'Black Out']. Start 5m right of 'Echo Crack', directly below right-hand side of big overhang high up. 1. 25m 5b 2. 15m From the belay, step down and make a thin traverse [5b] of the break to the delightful 5a crack which leads to the ledge at the left-hand side of the overhang. This ledge is shared with 'Echo Crack' and 'Jailbreak'. 3. 25m 5a As for 'Echo Crack' : Up crack, traverse right and up huge right-slanting corner. Direct finish ALWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE As for pitch 2 but continue by bridging up behind the overhanging block and finish up the arete. 50m of pure pleasure. Easy climbing in a stunning environment. ECHO CRACK 50m E2 5b, 5c Near the centre of the south-facing cliff is a large overhanging block at half-height. The climb starts vertically below this on a ledge at the detached tooth for the belayer to sit on. 1 25m Follow the left-slanting jamming crack to belay in the triangular niche at the top of the pillar 2. 25m From the niche, bridge up and jam the overhanging crack and make a spectacular and exciting move out unto the face at right [crux]. Claw up past vertical grass to ledge. Continue more easily up crack until forced to traverse right and up the pleasant comer to top. JAILBREAK 60m E3 5b,5c,4c,5a,5c 60m 1 25m 5b As for Echo Crack 2. 5m 5c As for Echo crack to ledge. Belay. 3 12m 4c Up crack to overhang. Place gear [2.5 friend] and traverse delicately left until ready to ascend on edges and pebbles to grassy ledge. 4. 8m 5a Clean corner. 5. 10m 6a Eschew the welcoming easy crack and chimney behind the holly bush. Instead, send your second leftwards past this to grovel around ledge, past crack to make a semi-hanging belay on large spikes out of sight. Climb crack to horizontal break [nuts] then fight up to large chock-stone and easier off width finish. ===East-facing cliff=== ERunning on Empty' [aka Physiognomy] is the formation that looks like the left-hand side of a face. This likeness may be seen, from, as far away as the road, to right to the base of the climb. Descent is by abseil from the first terrace above Pipers Groove. DROP LEFT 30m HVS 5a From the start of Running on Empty, make exposed moves to gain the arête. Follow this and the crack to the ledge. P Britton, C Ennis 17/3/09 onsight. RUNNING ON EMPTY 35m E1 5b Climb the right-facing corner to the first overhang [nose), move right under this and up to second overhang [eye-socket], right under this and up to terrace. Good protection. BRIAN'S SLAB 30m E1 5a The slab to the right of Piper's Groove. Totally absorbing climbing. The start is the hardest where the rock is broken and slightly undercut. Above, follow the crack near the left side of the slab for protection. As this fades to the left, transfer to the crack to the right and repeat higher up. Small gear throughout. PARCHMAN GROOVES 35m VS 4c 4c/5a These are major features, easily seen on approach (in fact, clearly marked, although not named, on the topo for the East- facing cliff). The lower groove leads to the Northern termination of the lower ‘prison’ terrace (although the terrace does continue, past the groove, to Crosseyed and Painless bay). The upper groove is an obvious open-book feature, capped, precariously, by a large block, that leads to the upper prison terrace. 1. 20 4c Enter the gully and bridge up the groove. At threequarters height is a squeeze chimney - should you choose to enter it. 2. 15m 4c/5a Climb a short slab to the groove. At the top of the groove - at the block, exit right (or left for variation). At the right hand [North] side of the east facing cliff is a bay with a big overhanging shelter over a slab. The following climbs are in this bay. * *AMULET 16m HVS 5b On the left i.e. north-facing wall of the bay, near the outer edge. Climb the thin crack and escape left onto platform, Up slab to second platform. Up crack to terrace. OLD DOG 14m E2 6a 4m right of Amulet. From the ramp, climb the short crack to where it splits the small overhang. Past this [crux] and follow crack to ledge. Top as for Amulet ECO VANDAL 15m VS 4c Start to left of Cross-eyed and Painless. Follow thin crack up ramp to vertical section then move left and up crack to vegetated ledge. Up short corner crack to terrace. CROSS-EYED AND PAINLESS 15m VS 4c Climb the right edge of the ramp, then ascend steeply up a thin crack to gain a ledge at the beginning of a niche which is climbed more easily to the top. WHIPPING BOY 15m E4 6a climbs the roof crack four meters right of cross-eyed and painless. Belay from a grassy ledge below the back of the roof. Climb the slab to gain the crack, climb this to a difficult move over the lip, continue up crack until it is possible to step right underneath smaller roof, climb through this on good holds and finish up short corner. H.Hennessy (unseconded) 24/4/21 (ground up after cleaning, one piece insitu from previous attempts) YONDER COMES MY MOTHER 40m E1 5b To the right (North) of Cross-eyed and Painless bay is a buttress.

On the way to this, there is a faint bulge; getting past this feels slightly committing as the crack disappears above and the next apparent protection is at the overhang. However, some small wire placements can be found. Above the overhang is easier climbing along the left side of a large flake. SHAK 45m VS 4c Located near the right end of the SW facing wall of the cliff. Start in a East facing groove approx. 5m from the corner. (1). 30m. Climb the groove to the top, then break right onto the wall, climbing steeply to a large belay ledge. (2). 15m. Climb easily but without protection on large holds to the top.

From higher up the gully Getting back down from these climbs is quite complex and a little bit magical. Head down the most southerly of the east facing part of the cliff. Keep right [looking out] and down-climb easy rock onto a ledge above a hole in the terrace below. The left end of this ledge leads to the terrace. Pass the aforementioned hole [which can be taken but involves a drop at the bottom] and descend the amazing little gully beyond which twists around and down to a second lower terrace. Head north on the terrace to the abseil point above Piper's Groove. THE OLD RUGGED CROSS 65m E2 5b, 5b, 5a This follows the sharp-edged left-facing flake crack that starts at 5m and continues to belay at holly tree [shared belay with 'Black Out'].

PARCHMAN GROOVES 35m VS 4c 4c/5a These are major features, easily seen on approach (in fact, clearly marked, although not named, on the topo for the East- facing cliff). The lower groove leads to the Northern termination of the lower ‘prison’ terrace (although the terrace does continue, past the groove, to Crosseyed and Painless bay).

Head down the most southerly of the east facing part of the cliff. Keep right [looking out] and down-climb easy rock onto a ledge above a hole in the terrace below. The left end of this ledge leads to the terrace. Pass the aforementioned hole [which can be taken but involves a drop at the bottom] and descend the amazing little gully beyond which twists around and down to a second lower terrace. Head north on the terrace to the abseil point above Piper's Groove. THE OLD RUGGED CROSS 65m E2 5b, 5b, 5a This follows the sharp-edged left-facing flake crack that starts at 5m and continues to belay at holly tree [shared belay with 'Black Out']. Start 5m right of 'Echo Crack', directly below right-hand side of big overhang high up. 1. 25m 5b 2. 15m From the belay, step down and make a thin traverse [5b] of the break to the delightful 5a crack which leads to the ledge at the left-hand side of the overhang. This ledge is shared with 'Echo Crack' and 'Jailbreak'. 3. 25m 5a As for 'Echo Crack' : Up crack, traverse right and up huge right-slanting corner. Direct finish ALWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE As for pitch 2 but continue by bridging up behind the overhanging block and finish up the arete. 50m of pure pleasure. Easy climbing in a stunning environment. ECHO CRACK 50m E2 5b, 5c Near the centre of the south-facing cliff is a large overhanging block at half-height. The climb starts vertically below this on a ledge at the detached tooth for the belayer to sit on. 1 25m Follow the left-slanting jamming crack to belay in the triangular niche at the top of the pillar 2. 25m From the niche, bridge up and jam the overhanging crack and make a spectacular and exciting move out unto the face at right [crux]. Claw up past vertical grass to ledge. Continue more easily up crack until forced to traverse right and up the pleasant comer to top. JAILBREAK 60m E3 5b,5c,4c,5a,5c 60m 1 25m 5b As for Echo Crack 2. 5m 5c As for Echo crack to ledge. Belay. 3 12m 4c Up crack to overhang. Place gear [2.5 friend] and traverse delicately left until ready to ascend on edges and pebbles to grassy ledge. 4. 8m 5a Clean corner. 5. 10m 6a Eschew the welcoming easy crack and chimney behind the holly bush. Instead, send your second leftwards past this to grovel around ledge, past crack to make a semi-hanging belay on large spikes out of sight. Climb crack to horizontal break [nuts] then fight up to large chock-stone and easier off width finish. ===East-facing cliff=== ERunning on Empty' [aka Physiognomy] is the formation that looks like the left-hand side of a face. This likeness may be seen, from, as far away as the road, to right to the base of the climb. Descent is by abseil from the first terrace above Pipers Groove. DROP LEFT 30m HVS 5a From the start of Running on Empty, make exposed moves to gain the arête. Follow this and the crack to the ledge. P Britton, C Ennis 17/3/09 onsight.

Above, follow the crack near the left side of the slab for protection. As this fades to the left, transfer to the crack to the right and repeat higher up. Small gear throughout. PARCHMAN GROOVES 35m VS 4c 4c/5a These are major features, easily seen on approach (in fact, clearly marked, although not named, on the topo for the East- facing cliff). The lower groove leads to the Northern termination of the lower ‘prison’ terrace (although the terrace does continue, past the groove, to Crosseyed and Painless bay). The upper groove is an obvious open-book feature, capped, precariously, by a large block, that leads to the upper prison terrace. 1. 20 4c Enter the gully and bridge up the groove. At threequarters height is a squeeze chimney - should you choose to enter it. 2. 15m 4c/5a Climb a short slab to the groove. At the top of the groove - at the block, exit right (or left for variation). At the right hand [North] side of the east facing cliff is a bay with a big overhanging shelter over a slab. The following climbs are in this bay. * *AMULET 16m HVS 5b On the left i.e. north-facing wall of the bay, near the outer edge.

H.Hennessy (unseconded) 24/4/21 (ground up after cleaning, one piece insitu from previous attempts) YONDER COMES MY MOTHER 40m E1 5b To the right (North) of Cross-eyed and Painless bay is a buttress. The right side of this is defined by a scar running the full height of the cliff - an obvious feature on approach. A long ramp, capped by a roof trends up to the right from this point. Closer up, the scar resolves into a corner facing NE, with a ragged crack in the back. #25m 5b. Climb the corner. At about 8m, an intermediate belay may be taken on the top of the large flake on the right. The crux is at the top, where the crack overhangs significantly. A no.4 Camalot gives some comfort at this point. Committing to the exit delivers one into a deep gully. Find reliable anchors for the belay further up the gully and return to the lip of the overhang to bring up your second. #15m Bridge easily but without protection up the gully and exit right, keeping alert for the possibility of loose rock.

From higher up the gully Getting back down from these climbs is quite complex and a little bit magical. Head down the most southerly of the east facing part of the cliff. Keep right [looking out] and down-climb easy rock onto a ledge above a hole in the terrace below. The left end of this ledge leads to the terrace. Pass the aforementioned hole [which can be taken but involves a drop at the bottom] and descend the amazing little gully beyond which twists around and down to a second lower terrace. Head north on the terrace to the abseil point above Piper's Groove.

Direct finish ALWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE As for pitch 2 but continue by bridging up behind the overhanging block and finish up the arete. 50m of pure pleasure. Easy climbing in a stunning environment. ECHO CRACK 50m E2 5b, 5c Near the centre of the south-facing cliff is a large overhanging block at half-height. The climb starts vertically below this on a ledge at the detached tooth for the belayer to sit on. 1 25m Follow the left-slanting jamming crack to belay in the triangular niche at the top of the pillar 2. 25m From the niche, bridge up and jam the overhanging crack and make a spectacular and exciting move out unto the face at right [crux].

Start below the obvious crack line in the middle of the face. Climb the crack directly, using plentiful holds and good gear placements (cams are especially useful). The climbing is steady with a crux in the middle. It is enjoyable throughout, finishing on easier ground above. A fine outing at the grade, offering a satisfying mix of movement and security. <u>An Giorra Butress</u> This little buttress with the following 2 routes is approximately 100m from the track (to the left) which leads to the Mahon Falls and is approx. 30m above it. It stands out as an obvious vertical and clean piece of rock, about 250m from the car-park, and its south-facing wall is marked on the right hand side by an obvious off-width crack. The first two climbs are at the south-facing wall (facing the car park): CALLUNA 10m HS 4b This route takes the vertical crack line which starts about 3m to the left of An Giorra Maol. Climb the crack for 4m to the rightward trending break, move to the right and continue steeply upwards on bigger and better holds. Belay well back. AN GIORRA MAOL 8m VS 4c This route takes the crackline about one meter to the left of the off-width crack. Well protected. PHLOGISTON 8m E2 6a The ‘obvious off-width’. The crack is deeply undercut at the bottom which makes getting established both difficult and strenuous. For protection, you will need two large cams: a largish one to cover the first move and a second bigger one (Camalot 5 or equivalent) higher up. Further 100 m into the valley, the next three climbs are at an east-facing wall (facing the footpath): LEFT HAND CRACK 8m HVS 5a Climb the left hand crack using some painful hand-jams. CENTRE CRACK 10m HVS 5a This route climbs the obvious jamming crack in the centre of the buttress. RIGHT HAND CRACK 8m HVS 5a The route climbs the thin crack on the right hand side of the wall to gain the terrace above. ==Keating’s Cliff (East-facing cliff)== The following routes are located on the left of the valley as you approach the Mahon Falls. Ancient Rain is in the middle of the high cliff above the path, just above an overhanging rock that juts out from the sloping hillside below. The crag shown in the topo is at the further continuation of this band of cliffs, near to the Falls. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ANCIENT RAIN 65m E2 4c, 5c This route is located on the large and steep crag high up on the left of the valley as you approach the Mahon Falls. It tackles the highest part of the cliff where a double stepped overhang dominates the wall. 1. 20m Start to the left of the overhang, at the base of a corner formed by a slanting and protruding slab/ramp which runs diagonally to the right. Climb up this corner and then the ensuing slab to the large recess below the overhangs. 2. 45m. Bridge up the corner on the left hand side of the overhang until you can commit yourself to the crux sequence on the steep left-hand wall. Keep going on past the overhangs to the niche above and into a groove on the left which eases off to a belay just below the top. Very good protection. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- image:coum mahon.jpg"

ASYLUM SEEKING 15m HVS 5b The corner to the left of Political World J Bergin, M Lyng POLITICAL WORLD 15m S 4a This climb follows the right edge of a steep wall near the top of the western gully higher up the gully than the start of The Dreaming. Start at an obvious leftward trending ramp. Climb this ramp with confidence until it is possible to place protection behind a large flake. Step left onto the wall and climb trending right, up a crack and steeply to the top. At the top of the gully, two short cleaned lines diverge in a narrow vee from the same start: DUMP TRUMP 10m HS 4b/c The left-hand line follows the corner. J. Bergin, G. Horgan THUMP TRUMP 10m VS 4c/5a The crack to the right. J. Bergin, A. Widger The following two climbs are on the corner of the right-hand buttress as you enter the above gully. BROKEN DREAMS 18m HS 3c Start 5m Left & 7m higher up of Big Bang Theory Climb obvious crack line for 8m, traverse left for 1.5m (Crux) then up slab section over obvious spikes (good protection) the route then joins into big bang theory. Tat has been placed for abseiling off both routes. BIG BANG THEORY 25m HS 4a Starting 5m right of the entrance to the large gully described in the above climbs on a West facing wall overlooking the main coum. Well protected for the top 18m or so of the climb, Big Bang Theory follows a varied width corner crack for the majority of the route. The crux is at approx 19m and involves exiting the crack/corner. After passing the crux proceed for 6m over a large block to belay. The top belay should be checked for loose rock but the stance is quite spacious and affords great views of the Mahon valley. Abseil descent off large block to gully floor. The following climbs ( Waterfall Slabs, Toadpipe, Raving, Screwtape ) were originally stated as being in Foill an Priosun, but best efforts at locating them place them on the North-East cliff (South-West facing) in Coum Mahon. This is on the basis of identifying and repeating Waterfall Slabs. ***************************************************************** N.B. The following routes are described, in order, from East (right) to West (left). WATERFALL SLABS 46m D The obvious water-worn slabs at the east end of the crag. Start just east of the right hand stream, cross it after about 12m and go up the slabs between the two streams to the top. Conglomerate - fairly sound. TOADPIPE 73m VD This climb is just to the left of the second big grass gully west from the waterfall. The gully is distinguishable by a rock island in its lower part. Start at the foot of a small slabby buttress. 1. 24m. Climb the buttress and scramble up grass to the foot of a wall. Conglomerate - fairly sound. 2. 12m. Climb the wall moving left. , then right to a ledge. Conglomerate - fairly sound. 3. 9m. Climb the wall above the ledge. Go diagonally left. , then move right just below a grass ledge and climb into a recess. Conglomerate - fairly sound. 4. 9m. Pull out of the recess, up rock, and then steep grass to the foot of a chimney in a corner. Conglomerate - fairly sound. The chimney is the logical finish, but it is very loose (sandstone) and the climb was finished as follows - 5. 18m. Traverse left round a corner into a grassy recess and then climb a chimney to easy ground. Sandstone - loose. TOADPIPE DIRECT 71m VS 4b, 4b, 4b, 4c/5a In trying to find the fit between the physical features of this buttress and the written description of Toadpipe , the conclusion is reached that that route follows ‘the line of least resistance’ . At the top, in particular, the only possible match with the loose sandstone chimneys mentioned, is on heather up the scruffy right hand side of the buttress. The Direct route takes an uncompromising line up the centre of the buttress, heading for the large right-facing corner at the top. The climbing is not difficult but the exposure is considerable and protection minimal, including at the belays. 1. 28m 4b A show of intent is given by climbing straight through the overhang halfway up (having placed the first and last protection of the pitch) rather than skirting around it to the left. Continue up heather to the next rock wall. 2. 22m 4b Straight up to a good ledge. 3. 15m 4b To corner. 4. 6m 4c/5a Corner to top. SUPER FLUMINA 82m E1 3c 5a 5b Location: This goes up the centre, to the highest point of the Screwtape/Raving buttress, going straight through some unlikely-looking overhanging territory in its the upper reaches. Start: 20m to the right of the rib of Raving. 1. 30m 3c Scramble up the 45 degree sloping ramp leftwards to a little bay, backed by a clean rock face and a poor belay at its left-hand side. 2. 24m 5a Traverse right atop a thin sheet of soggy vegetation to a wet corner and good anchors. Climb up here, going out from the corner to the arete. Continue up the edge of a large flake, pass behind this, and up another arete to a large grassy ledge. This ledge has been otherwise untroubled by the feet of men or beasts. 3. 28m 5b Climb up from where you arrived at the ledge, being careful not to dislodge the loose blocks near the arete and continue up the grooves above. These grooves are the product of two intersecting sets of vertical joints that here give rise to a series of grooves of about 60 degrees, separated from their neighbours by little aretes of a similar angle, producing, in this part of the cliff only, a columnar appearance to the rock. The first two pitches were climbed on sight. The top 10m of the top pitch was glanced at, but not touched, two years earlier on abseil in a scan of the likely feasibility of the line. RAVING 137m HS Start - To the right of Screwtape 1. Up the obvious rib. 2. Loose rock to a belay in the corner. 3. A steep wall to easier ground. 4. Traverse left and finish up last pitch of Screwtape. (There is a direct finish but it is loose and was not led). SCREWTAPE 79m HS Start - Just right of a deep gully, the third from the waterfall slabs below a big nose. 1. 18m. Up a few feet, then move left onto the nose, up, back R. and straight up to a ledge. (Conglomerate - rotten). 2. 15m. Up the wall on the left, then R. , then L. round the bulge and up easily to the bridge of the nose (Conglomerate - very rotten). 3. 24m. Up grass slopes heading for the L. edge of the big buttress above. Then traverse R. on loose flakes and climb up into the recess, (Sandstone - loose). 4. 21m. Up grass slopes heading for the L. edge of the big buttress above. but for more interest, traverse R. down a grassy ramp, swing round onto a rib, and climb it to the top. (Sandstone). <u>Screwtape Revisited</u> There is evidence, on both sides of the valley for the squeezing of the rocks, at some time, along an axis approximately SE - NW. This is most apparent in the finer-grained layers, resulting in a cleavage at a high angle to the more-or-less horizontal lie of the beds. It can also be seen, though less-well developed in the coarser-grained conglomerate. Screwtape is a good place to observe this! SCREWTAPE REVISITED 80m E1 4c, 4c, Diff, 5b, 5a 1. 18m 4c Good climbing as described. Rock: flaky-looking but, treated with respect, good. 2. 15m 4c As described. Rock quality of initial wall excellent; then a scramble to a little col. 3. 20m Diff. A little bit of easy rock, then grass, then more easy rock and more grass. Rock quality: irrelevant. 4. 20m 5b Go up easily to a little rock wall above a patch of small willows and place some good protection. Then, descend to the right, behind the trees, to the edge of the void. [It might be necessary to pull up one rope and throw it back down, so that it can be clear of the trees.] Edge gingerly across to gain the undercut arete, avoiding some suspect flakes. A couple of moves brings you to a position of remarkable exposure - standing on a small square jutting block, with 60m of fresh air beneath your feet. Go around the arete and make some technical moves to a ledge. Rock quality: excellent. AT THE PITTES BRINKE 65m E1 5a 5b/c 20m to the right of The Line, a moist corner slants across to the left at an angle of 30 degrees to meet an overlap at 10m. 1. 38m 5a Start a couple of metres left of the corner and climb the slab, heading for the junction between corner and overlap. Good protection can be found here for the move through the overlap. On the slab above, follow the left slanting crack until it becomes a small corner and here climb the little arete to grass and gear (30m). Make a rising traverse across grass and woodrush for 8m to a good stance below the square arete. 2. 27m 5b/c climb the arete, mostly on its right hand side to its apex. Then, move boldly right, following a thin curving undercut crack onto the hanging slab. Thin moves but with some good protection, lead up past a fist-sized slot to the top. Abseiled previously to check the availability of protection above the overlap on pitch one and for some cleaning at the overlap. Little or no account was taken of the second pitch. THE LINE 65m E2 5b 5b Location: In the centre of the cliff, mid-way between Jacob’s Ladder and Screwtape. The first pitch climbs the ruler-straight left-facing corner; the second pitch continues up the left side of the light-coloured prow above. 1. 40m 5b. Easy ground, then keep to the slab to the right until you can step left onto the grass pad in the corner. Above, the back wall bulges. Getting up this is the crux and the gear here is small, hard to find and hard to trust but ‘be ye men of valour’ , there are better holds and gear-placements above. Follow the corner to its very end (including the grassy top) to belay immediately below the headwall. 2. 25m 5b Follow the cracks above the belay. Holds and gear placements abound but the wall overhangs slightly making it quite pumpy. The angle eases towards the top. AND I SAW A NEW HEAVEN 68m E1 5a 5b An excellent route with a good variety of climbing. The first pitch may look a little scruffy and ill-defined but the climbing is good and the route makes perfect sense when you are on it. Location: Midway between Jacob’s Ladder and The Line, is a poorly-defined, broken A-shaped buttress, just to the right of the start of Artemis and Apollo; at its base is a clean 8m slab at a comfortable angle. 1. 38m 5a Climb the slab (unprotected) then move left to rough rock. Go up the arete and then the left-slanting corner, then up a steep crack. This leads to a near-vertical grass sheet. Before this is reached, a broken crack joins from the right. Follow this at an easier angle, over vegetation and go up past a square jammed flake of unknown security to belay in a corner beside a patch of furze. 2. 30m 5b From the belay, move out boldly right onto the clean jutting nose. Climb to the top of this (good nuts in a crack) and move to the right into a rectangular recess resembling a door-case, complete with a square-cut lintel making a little roof at the top. Exit left into the generous cleaned groove and continue up into the clean corner above. Go up past the peg to the top of the corner and top out to the right The route was first attempted on 29/4. The first pitch received extensive cleaning with an ice-axe on lead. The second pitch was not amenable to on-sight cleaning and, in its uncleaned state did not seem ‘justifiable’ , and a different (though not easier or safer) line was taken to the left. This was written up at the time as Sicut Cervus E2 5a 5b but can safely be relegated to the position of footnote. The corner and (especially) the groove were cleaned a week later on abseil and, because the climbing seemed thin and the protection seemed lacking, a peg was put in. As it turns out, the peg wasn't really necessary but it is still reassuring for the final crux move topping out. If your ethics or conscience do not allow you to clip it, then don’t . Either way, only God (and your second) will know and no one will care. ARTEMIS 80m E2 5a 5b/c Location: 10m to the right (East) of Unseen Things Above, the first pitch climbs the left-slanting groove between the flake/buttress and the wall behind. (Unseen Things climbs the left edge of this buttress). The groove is vegetated but this is of no consequence since the climbing consists of bridging between the edge of the flake and the clean, solid and delightfully knobbly back wall. The top 25m of the second pitch is superb high-quality climbing on clean rock. 1. 35m 5a. Up a couple of metres of vegetation to reach rock and then the groove. Bridge up this to a grassy belay. 2. 45m 5b/c. From the belay, go up and right over easy ground for 20m towards the (very small) corner in the centre of the face. Where the rock steepens, follow the edge of the triangular flake to the base of the corner . This is marked by a small square plate jutting from a slot. Climb confidently to the top, finding good protection from small nuts for most of the way. APOLLO 80m HVS 5a 4c 1. 35m 5a Pitch 1 of Artemis. 2. 45m 4c From the belay, go up and slightly left towards a stunted (pedunculate-) oak tree. Squirm past this on the right and follow a good edge and crack towards a (scary-looking but actually sound) hanging flake. Pass this on the left to the top. UNSEEN THINGS ABOVE 80m E2 5b 5c 5b Location: Jacob’s Ladder is easily identified by the detached block at its base. The bay to the right (East) of it is defined on its right hand side by an obvious overhanging corner/groove. 1. 30m 5b Climb the groove, exiting right into a good belay nest. 2. 25m 5c From the belay, traverse delicately left for two metres to a narrow grass ledge and follow the crack up to the slot above. Intricate climbing through this leads to a grassy platform. 3. 25m 5b. From the belay, go up and, on the left of the arete, pull strenuously up the flake-crack to a stance and then, to avoid thin suspect flakes, keep left and climb spectacularly up the edge of the thin-but-solid sharp arete to its top. From here, protection can be found in the bottom of the crack to the left, which separates the glass-smooth slab from heathery rock. The top is a few metres up. Walk off from here i.e. below the top band of rock. JACOB'S LADDER 82m HS [original grade - but read to the end] This is a good climb in a good situation. The route climbs the stepped-ladder feature, one third of the way down the crag from Mahon Falls, that forms the right-hand boundary of the large wide-vee gully. The left-hand branch of this gully provides a convenient [if somewhat sketchy] descent. The route starts from a detached boulder. 1. 25m. Climb straight up the face of the rib to grassy top. 2. 35m. Up slab and obvious vee-chimney. Continue up smooth slab to grass ledge. ART THOU ELIAS? 60m VS 4c 4c Location: This is the stepped arete opposite Jacob’s Ladder , across the mouth of the forked gully. It is the next gully right (East) from Dreaming Gully. 1. 20m 4c + 10m to the belay. Start just left of the ‘Plank’ and follow the rough crack which snakes up to a little overhang at the top. Go through the centre of this overhang to a lovely little promontory. 2. 30m Severe, except for one 4c move as described: At the overhanging split nose, move up to the right and make an exciting move onto a small flat foothold just above the overhang on the point of the nose, and continue up the groove. Scramble up to the terrace and descend via Dreaming Gully (Forked Gully not recommended without prior knowledge). SUMMER OF ‘69 63m HVS 4c 4c 4b Location: About 60m right from Dreaming Gully - mid-way between it and Forked Gully - is a dark wet blind gully with a jammed square block. The route starts at the right hand side of this gully. 1. 28m 4c Climb the rib, heading for the corner above. A considered, cautious approach to the rock is indicated for the rib. At the band of vegetation, follow the crack on the left and up heather to belay below the corner. 2. 25m 4c Good climbing up the corner, with good gear. Belay at the comfortable ledge. 3.10m 4b Climb up and to the right towards the attractive face of the overhanging prow and up this easily but spectacularly to belay above. Cross the heather isthmus and up the easy-angled slab to the terrace. CAMEL MEETS NEEDLE 80m E2 4c 5c Location: mid-way between Dreaming Gully and Forked Gully is the blind gully/chimney with the jammed blocks mentioned above. Ten or twelve metres left from this, a scruffy arete slants up to converge at the same point at the top. This arete is an obvious feature and draws the eye as you approach the Falls. 1. 50m 4c Start below the arete, which is undercut at the bottom. Surmount the overhang (gear available below it) to gain the arete. Continue for 50m to the bare rock pillar. Some vegetation must be passed on the journey up. Protection is well-spaced but sufficient. 2. 30m 5c Continue easily and securely to the crux slot. This is awkward and committing: movement is limited by the confines of the slot, and the overlying left wall pushes the climber off balance. Once the move is initiated, there is no going back, as, because it is undercut here, the feet are lost. Move right onto the hanging slab, and more-easily up to the cave. Wriggle through the window to emerge on top. Good belay anchors are to be found just across the neck, looking down into Forked Gully. If it turns out that you are too well-fed to fit through the window (it is quite small), all is not lost: the rock to the left of the cave is climbable. Likewise, if defeated by the crux slot, a traverse right from above the belay will take you to the main gully groove, which is fairly-easily climbable at this point (this was checked on abseil). A note on the grade: The character and challenges of each of the two pitches is so completely different, that coming up with an overall grade is difficult. The technical crux is stiff, but short and well-protected; the first pitch is not technically difficult but might disconcert those unused to such terrain. The grade given attempts to take both these considerations into account. N.B For historical reasons, the routes on the cliff are listed from right (SE) to left (NW) - which is why the route above is the closest to Dreaming Gully."

Step left onto the wall and climb trending right, up a crack and steeply to the top. At the top of the gully, two short cleaned lines diverge in a narrow vee from the same start: DUMP TRUMP 10m HS 4b/c The left-hand line follows the corner. J. Bergin, G. Horgan THUMP TRUMP 10m VS 4c/5a The crack to the right. J. Bergin, A. Widger The following two climbs are on the corner of the right-hand buttress as you enter the above gully. BROKEN DREAMS 18m HS 3c Start 5m Left & 7m higher up of Big Bang Theory Climb obvious crack line for 8m, traverse left for 1.5m (Crux) then up slab section over obvious spikes (good protection) the route then joins into big bang theory. Tat has been placed for abseiling off both routes. BIG BANG THEORY 25m HS 4a Starting 5m right of the entrance to the large gully described in the above climbs on a West facing wall overlooking the main coum. Well protected for the top 18m or so of the climb, Big Bang Theory follows a varied width corner crack for the majority of the route. The crux is at approx 19m and involves exiting the crack/corner. After passing the crux proceed for 6m over a large block to belay. The top belay should be checked for loose rock but the stance is quite spacious and affords great views of the Mahon valley. Abseil descent off large block to gully floor. The following climbs ( Waterfall Slabs, Toadpipe, Raving, Screwtape ) were originally stated as being in Foill an Priosun, but best efforts at locating them place them on the North-East cliff (South-West facing) in Coum Mahon. This is on the basis of identifying and repeating Waterfall Slabs. ***************************************************************** N.B. The following routes are described, in order, from East (right) to West (left). WATERFALL SLABS 46m D The obvious water-worn slabs at the east end of the crag. Start just east of the right hand stream, cross it after about 12m and go up the slabs between the two streams to the top. Conglomerate - fairly sound. TOADPIPE 73m VD This climb is just to the left of the second big grass gully west from the waterfall. The gully is distinguishable by a rock island in its lower part. Start at the foot of a small slabby buttress. 1. 24m. Climb the buttress and scramble up grass to the foot of a wall. Conglomerate - fairly sound. 2. 12m. Climb the wall moving left. , then right to a ledge. Conglomerate - fairly sound. 3. 9m. Climb the wall above the ledge. Go diagonally left. , then move right just below a grass ledge and climb into a recess. Conglomerate - fairly sound. 4. 9m. Pull out of the recess, up rock, and then steep grass to the foot of a chimney in a corner. Conglomerate - fairly sound. The chimney is the logical finish, but it is very loose (sandstone) and the climb was finished as follows - 5. 18m. Traverse left round a corner into a grassy recess and then climb a chimney to easy ground. Sandstone - loose. TOADPIPE DIRECT 71m VS 4b, 4b, 4b, 4c/5a In trying to find the fit between the physical features of this buttress and the written description of Toadpipe , the conclusion is reached that that route follows ‘the line of least resistance’ . At the top, in particular, the only possible match with the loose sandstone chimneys mentioned, is on heather up the scruffy right hand side of the buttress. The Direct route takes an uncompromising line up the centre of the buttress, heading for the large right-facing corner at the top. The climbing is not difficult but the exposure is considerable and protection minimal, including at the belays. 1. 28m 4b A show of intent is given by climbing straight through the overhang halfway up (having placed the first and last protection of the pitch) rather than skirting around it to the left. Continue up heather to the next rock wall. 2. 22m 4b Straight up to a good ledge. 3. 15m 4b To corner. 4. 6m 4c/5a Corner to top. SUPER FLUMINA 82m E1 3c 5a 5b Location: This goes up the centre, to the highest point of the Screwtape/Raving buttress, going straight through some unlikely-looking overhanging territory in its the upper reaches. Start: 20m to the right of the rib of Raving. 1. 30m 3c Scramble up the 45 degree sloping ramp leftwards to a little bay, backed by a clean rock face and a poor belay at its left-hand side. 2. 24m 5a Traverse right atop a thin sheet of soggy vegetation to a wet corner and good anchors. Climb up here, going out from the corner to the arete. Continue up the edge of a large flake, pass behind this, and up another arete to a large grassy ledge. This ledge has been otherwise untroubled by the feet of men or beasts. 3. 28m 5b Climb up from where you arrived at the ledge, being careful not to dislodge the loose blocks near the arete and continue up the grooves above. These grooves are the product of two intersecting sets of vertical joints that here give rise to a series of grooves of about 60 degrees, separated from their neighbours by little aretes of a similar angle, producing, in this part of the cliff only, a columnar appearance to the rock. The first two pitches were climbed on sight. The top 10m of the top pitch was glanced at, but not touched, two years earlier on abseil in a scan of the likely feasibility of the line. RAVING 137m HS Start - To the right of Screwtape 1. Up the obvious rib. 2. Loose rock to a belay in the corner. 3. A steep wall to easier ground. 4. Traverse left and finish up last pitch of Screwtape. (There is a direct finish but it is loose and was not led). SCREWTAPE 79m HS Start - Just right of a deep gully, the third from the waterfall slabs below a big nose. 1. 18m. Up a few feet, then move left onto the nose, up, back R. and straight up to a ledge. (Conglomerate - rotten). 2. 15m. Up the wall on the left, then R. , then L. round the bulge and up easily to the bridge of the nose (Conglomerate - very rotten). 3. 24m. Up grass slopes heading for the L. edge of the big buttress above. Then traverse R. on loose flakes and climb up into the recess, (Sandstone - loose). 4. 21m. Up grass slopes heading for the L. edge of the big buttress above. but for more interest, traverse R. down a grassy ramp, swing round onto a rib, and climb it to the top. (Sandstone). <u>Screwtape Revisited</u> There is evidence, on both sides of the valley for the squeezing of the rocks, at some time, along an axis approximately SE - NW. This is most apparent in the finer-grained layers, resulting in a cleavage at a high angle to the more-or-less horizontal lie of the beds. It can also be seen, though less-well developed in the coarser-grained conglomerate. Screwtape is a good place to observe this! SCREWTAPE REVISITED 80m E1 4c, 4c, Diff, 5b, 5a 1. 18m 4c Good climbing as described. Rock: flaky-looking but, treated with respect, good. 2. 15m 4c As described. Rock quality of initial wall excellent; then a scramble to a little col. 3. 20m Diff. A little bit of easy rock, then grass, then more easy rock and more grass. Rock quality: irrelevant. 4. 20m 5b Go up easily to a little rock wall above a patch of small willows and place some good protection. Then, descend to the right, behind the trees, to the edge of the void. [It might be necessary to pull up one rope and throw it back down, so that it can be clear of the trees.] Edge gingerly across to gain the undercut arete, avoiding some suspect flakes. A couple of moves brings you to a position of remarkable exposure - standing on a small square jutting block, with 60m of fresh air beneath your feet. Go around the arete and make some technical moves to a ledge. Rock quality: excellent. AT THE PITTES BRINKE 65m E1 5a 5b/c 20m to the right of The Line, a moist corner slants across to the left at an angle of 30 degrees to meet an overlap at 10m. 1. 38m 5a Start a couple of metres left of the corner and climb the slab, heading for the junction between corner and overlap. Good protection can be found here for the move through the overlap. On the slab above, follow the left slanting crack until it becomes a small corner and here climb the little arete to grass and gear (30m). Make a rising traverse across grass and woodrush for 8m to a good stance below the square arete. 2. 27m 5b/c climb the arete, mostly on its right hand side to its apex. Then, move boldly right, following a thin curving undercut crack onto the hanging slab. Thin moves but with some good protection, lead up past a fist-sized slot to the top. Abseiled previously to check the availability of protection above the overlap on pitch one and for some cleaning at the overlap. Little or no account was taken of the second pitch. THE LINE 65m E2 5b 5b Location: In the centre of the cliff, mid-way between Jacob’s Ladder and Screwtape. The first pitch climbs the ruler-straight left-facing corner; the second pitch continues up the left side of the light-coloured prow above. 1. 40m 5b. Easy ground, then keep to the slab to the right until you can step left onto the grass pad in the corner. Above, the back wall bulges. Getting up this is the crux and the gear here is small, hard to find and hard to trust but ‘be ye men of valour’ , there are better holds and gear-placements above. Follow the corner to its very end (including the grassy top) to belay immediately below the headwall. 2. 25m 5b Follow the cracks above the belay. Holds and gear placements abound but the wall overhangs slightly making it quite pumpy. The angle eases towards the top. AND I SAW A NEW HEAVEN 68m E1 5a 5b An excellent route with a good variety of climbing. The first pitch may look a little scruffy and ill-defined but the climbing is good and the route makes perfect sense when you are on it. Location: Midway between Jacob’s Ladder and The Line, is a poorly-defined, broken A-shaped buttress, just to the right of the start of Artemis and Apollo; at its base is a clean 8m slab at a comfortable angle. 1. 38m 5a Climb the slab (unprotected) then move left to rough rock. Go up the arete and then the left-slanting corner, then up a steep crack. This leads to a near-vertical grass sheet. Before this is reached, a broken crack joins from the right. Follow this at an easier angle, over vegetation and go up past a square jammed flake of unknown security to belay in a corner beside a patch of furze. 2. 30m 5b From the belay, move out boldly right onto the clean jutting nose. Climb to the top of this (good nuts in a crack) and move to the right into a rectangular recess resembling a door-case, complete with a square-cut lintel making a little roof at the top. Exit left into the generous cleaned groove and continue up into the clean corner above. Go up past the peg to the top of the corner and top out to the right The route was first attempted on 29/4. The first pitch received extensive cleaning with an ice-axe on lead. The second pitch was not amenable to on-sight cleaning and, in its uncleaned state did not seem ‘justifiable’ , and a different (though not easier or safer) line was taken to the left. This was written up at the time as Sicut Cervus E2 5a 5b but can safely be relegated to the position of footnote. The corner and (especially) the groove were cleaned a week later on abseil and, because the climbing seemed thin and the protection seemed lacking, a peg was put in. As it turns out, the peg wasn't really necessary but it is still reassuring for the final crux move topping out. If your ethics or conscience do not allow you to clip it, then don’t . Either way, only God (and your second) will know and no one will care. ARTEMIS 80m E2 5a 5b/c Location: 10m to the right (East) of Unseen Things Above, the first pitch climbs the left-slanting groove between the flake/buttress and the wall behind. (Unseen Things climbs the left edge of this buttress). The groove is vegetated but this is of no consequence since the climbing consists of bridging between the edge of the flake and the clean, solid and delightfully knobbly back wall. The top 25m of the second pitch is superb high-quality climbing on clean rock. 1. 35m 5a. Up a couple of metres of vegetation to reach rock and then the groove. Bridge up this to a grassy belay. 2. 45m 5b/c. From the belay, go up and right over easy ground for 20m towards the (very small) corner in the centre of the face. Where the rock steepens, follow the edge of the triangular flake to the base of the corner . This is marked by a small square plate jutting from a slot. Climb confidently to the top, finding good protection from small nuts for most of the way. APOLLO 80m HVS 5a 4c 1. 35m 5a Pitch 1 of Artemis. 2. 45m 4c From the belay, go up and slightly left towards a stunted (pedunculate-) oak tree. Squirm past this on the right and follow a good edge and crack towards a (scary-looking but actually sound) hanging flake. Pass this on the left to the top. UNSEEN THINGS ABOVE 80m E2 5b 5c 5b Location: Jacob’s Ladder is easily identified by the detached block at its base. The bay to the right (East) of it is defined on its right hand side by an obvious overhanging corner/groove. 1. 30m 5b Climb the groove, exiting right into a good belay nest. 2. 25m 5c From the belay, traverse delicately left for two metres to a narrow grass ledge and follow the crack up to the slot above. Intricate climbing through this leads to a grassy platform. 3. 25m 5b. From the belay, go up and, on the left of the arete, pull strenuously up the flake-crack to a stance and then, to avoid thin suspect flakes, keep left and climb spectacularly up the edge of the thin-but-solid sharp arete to its top. From here, protection can be found in the bottom of the crack to the left, which separates the glass-smooth slab from heathery rock. The top is a few metres up. Walk off from here i.e. below the top band of rock. JACOB'S LADDER 82m HS [original grade - but read to the end] This is a good climb in a good situation. The route climbs the stepped-ladder feature, one third of the way down the crag from Mahon Falls, that forms the right-hand boundary of the large wide-vee gully. The left-hand branch of this gully provides a convenient [if somewhat sketchy] descent. The route starts from a detached boulder. 1. 25m. Climb straight up the face of the rib to grassy top. 2. 35m. Up slab and obvious vee-chimney. Continue up smooth slab to grass ledge. ART THOU ELIAS? 60m VS 4c 4c Location: This is the stepped arete opposite Jacob’s Ladder , across the mouth of the forked gully. It is the next gully right (East) from Dreaming Gully. 1. 20m 4c + 10m to the belay. Start just left of the ‘Plank’ and follow the rough crack which snakes up to a little overhang at the top. Go through the centre of this overhang to a lovely little promontory. 2. 30m Severe, except for one 4c move as described: At the overhanging split nose, move up to the right and make an exciting move onto a small flat foothold just above the overhang on the point of the nose, and continue up the groove. Scramble up to the terrace and descend via Dreaming Gully (Forked Gully not recommended without prior knowledge). SUMMER OF ‘69 63m HVS 4c 4c 4b Location: About 60m right from Dreaming Gully - mid-way between it and Forked Gully - is a dark wet blind gully with a jammed square block. The route starts at the right hand side of this gully. 1. 28m 4c Climb the rib, heading for the corner above. A considered, cautious approach to the rock is indicated for the rib. At the band of vegetation, follow the crack on the left and up heather to belay below the corner. 2. 25m 4c Good climbing up the corner, with good gear. Belay at the comfortable ledge. 3.10m 4b Climb up and to the right towards the attractive face of the overhanging prow and up this easily but spectacularly to belay above. Cross the heather isthmus and up the easy-angled slab to the terrace. CAMEL MEETS NEEDLE 80m E2 4c 5c Location: mid-way between Dreaming Gully and Forked Gully is the blind gully/chimney with the jammed blocks mentioned above. Ten or twelve metres left from this, a scruffy arete slants up to converge at the same point at the top. This arete is an obvious feature and draws the eye as you approach the Falls. 1. 50m 4c Start below the arete, which is undercut at the bottom. Surmount the overhang (gear available below it) to gain the arete. Continue for 50m to the bare rock pillar. Some vegetation must be passed on the journey up. Protection is well-spaced but sufficient. 2. 30m 5c Continue easily and securely to the crux slot. This is awkward and committing: movement is limited by the confines of the slot, and the overlying left wall pushes the climber off balance. Once the move is initiated, there is no going back, as, because it is undercut here, the feet are lost. Move right onto the hanging slab, and more-easily up to the cave. Wriggle through the window to emerge on top. Good belay anchors are to be found just across the neck, looking down into Forked Gully. If it turns out that you are too well-fed to fit through the window (it is quite small), all is not lost: the rock to the left of the cave is climbable. Likewise, if defeated by the crux slot, a traverse right from above the belay will take you to the main gully groove, which is fairly-easily climbable at this point (this was checked on abseil). A note on the grade: The character and challenges of each of the two pitches is so completely different, that coming up with an overall grade is difficult. The technical crux is stiff, but short and well-protected; the first pitch is not technically difficult but might disconcert those unused to such terrain. The grade given attempts to take both these considerations into account. N.B For historical reasons, the routes on the cliff are listed from right (SE) to left (NW) - which is why the route above is the closest to Dreaming Gully."

Abseiled previously to check the availability of protection above the overlap on pitch one and for some cleaning at the overlap. Little or no account was taken of the second pitch. THE LINE 65m E2 5b 5b Location: In the centre of the cliff, mid-way between Jacob’s Ladder and Screwtape. The first pitch climbs the ruler-straight left-facing corner; the second pitch continues up the left side of the light-coloured prow above. 1. 40m 5b. Easy ground, then keep to the slab to the right until you can step left onto the grass pad in the corner. Above, the back wall bulges. Getting up this is the crux and the gear here is small, hard to find and hard to trust but ‘be ye men of valour’ , there are better holds and gear-placements above. Follow the corner to its very end (including the grassy top) to belay immediately below the headwall. 2. 25m 5b Follow the cracks above the belay. Holds and gear placements abound but the wall overhangs slightly making it quite pumpy. The angle eases towards the top. AND I SAW A NEW HEAVEN 68m E1 5a 5b An excellent route with a good variety of climbing. The first pitch may look a little scruffy and ill-defined but the climbing is good and the route makes perfect sense when you are on it. Location: Midway between Jacob’s Ladder and The Line, is a poorly-defined, broken A-shaped buttress, just to the right of the start of Artemis and Apollo; at its base is a clean 8m slab at a comfortable angle. 1. 38m 5a Climb the slab (unprotected) then move left to rough rock. Go up the arete and then the left-slanting corner, then up a steep crack. This leads to a near-vertical grass sheet. Before this is reached, a broken crack joins from the right. Follow this at an easier angle, over vegetation and go up past a square jammed flake of unknown security to belay in a corner beside a patch of furze. 2. 30m 5b From the belay, move out boldly right onto the clean jutting nose. Climb to the top of this (good nuts in a crack) and move to the right into a rectangular recess resembling a door-case, complete with a square-cut lintel making a little roof at the top. Exit left into the generous cleaned groove and continue up into the clean corner above. Go up past the peg to the top of the corner and top out to the right The route was first attempted on 29/4. The first pitch received extensive cleaning with an ice-axe on lead. The second pitch was not amenable to on-sight cleaning and, in its uncleaned state did not seem ‘justifiable’ , and a different (though not easier or safer) line was taken to the left. This was written up at the time as Sicut Cervus E2 5a 5b but can safely be relegated to the position of footnote. The corner and (especially) the groove were cleaned a week later on abseil and, because the climbing seemed thin and the protection seemed lacking, a peg was put in. As it turns out, the peg wasn't really necessary but it is still reassuring for the final crux move topping out. If your ethics or conscience do not allow you to clip it, then don’t . Either way, only God (and your second) will know and no one will care. ARTEMIS 80m E2 5a 5b/c Location: 10m to the right (East) of Unseen Things Above, the first pitch climbs the left-slanting groove between the flake/buttress and the wall behind. (Unseen Things climbs the left edge of this buttress). The groove is vegetated but this is of no consequence since the climbing consists of bridging between the edge of the flake and the clean, solid and delightfully knobbly back wall. The top 25m of the second pitch is superb high-quality climbing on clean rock. 1. 35m 5a. Up a couple of metres of vegetation to reach rock and then the groove. Bridge up this to a grassy belay. 2. 45m 5b/c. From the belay, go up and right over easy ground for 20m towards the (very small) corner in the centre of the face. Where the rock steepens, follow the edge of the triangular flake to the base of the corner . This is marked by a small square plate jutting from a slot. Climb confidently to the top, finding good protection from small nuts for most of the way. APOLLO 80m HVS 5a 4c 1. 35m 5a Pitch 1 of Artemis. 2. 45m 4c From the belay, go up and slightly left towards a stunted (pedunculate-) oak tree. Squirm past this on the right and follow a good edge and crack towards a (scary-looking but actually sound) hanging flake. Pass this on the left to the top. UNSEEN THINGS ABOVE 80m E2 5b 5c 5b Location: Jacob’s Ladder is easily identified by the detached block at its base. The bay to the right (East) of it is defined on its right hand side by an obvious overhanging corner/groove. 1. 30m 5b Climb the groove, exiting right into a good belay nest. 2. 25m 5c From the belay, traverse delicately left for two metres to a narrow grass ledge and follow the crack up to the slot above. Intricate climbing through this leads to a grassy platform. 3. 25m 5b. From the belay, go up and, on the left of the arete, pull strenuously up the flake-crack to a stance and then, to avoid thin suspect flakes, keep left and climb spectacularly up the edge of the thin-but-solid sharp arete to its top. From here, protection can be found in the bottom of the crack to the left, which separates the glass-smooth slab from heathery rock. The top is a few metres up. Walk off from here i.e. below the top band of rock. JACOB'S LADDER 82m HS [original grade - but read to the end] This is a good climb in a good situation. The route climbs the stepped-ladder feature, one third of the way down the crag from Mahon Falls, that forms the right-hand boundary of the large wide-vee gully. The left-hand branch of this gully provides a convenient [if somewhat sketchy] descent. The route starts from a detached boulder. 1. 25m. Climb straight up the face of the rib to grassy top. 2. 35m. Up slab and obvious vee-chimney. Continue up smooth slab to grass ledge. ART THOU ELIAS? 60m VS 4c 4c Location: This is the stepped arete opposite Jacob’s Ladder , across the mouth of the forked gully. It is the next gully right (East) from Dreaming Gully. 1. 20m 4c + 10m to the belay. Start just left of the ‘Plank’ and follow the rough crack which snakes up to a little overhang at the top. Go through the centre of this overhang to a lovely little promontory. 2. 30m Severe, except for one 4c move as described: At the overhanging split nose, move up to the right and make an exciting move onto a small flat foothold just above the overhang on the point of the nose, and continue up the groove. Scramble up to the terrace and descend via Dreaming Gully (Forked Gully not recommended without prior knowledge). SUMMER OF ‘69 63m HVS 4c 4c 4b Location: About 60m right from Dreaming Gully - mid-way between it and Forked Gully - is a dark wet blind gully with a jammed square block. The route starts at the right hand side of this gully. 1. 28m 4c Climb the rib, heading for the corner above. A considered, cautious approach to the rock is indicated for the rib. At the band of vegetation, follow the crack on the left and up heather to belay below the corner. 2. 25m 4c Good climbing up the corner, with good gear. Belay at the comfortable ledge. 3.10m 4b Climb up and to the right towards the attractive face of the overhanging prow and up this easily but spectacularly to belay above. Cross the heather isthmus and up the easy-angled slab to the terrace. CAMEL MEETS NEEDLE 80m E2 4c 5c Location: mid-way between Dreaming Gully and Forked Gully is the blind gully/chimney with the jammed blocks mentioned above. Ten or twelve metres left from this, a scruffy arete slants up to converge at the same point at the top. This arete is an obvious feature and draws the eye as you approach the Falls. 1. 50m 4c Start below the arete, which is undercut at the bottom. Surmount the overhang (gear available below it) to gain the arete. Continue for 50m to the bare rock pillar. Some vegetation must be passed on the journey up. Protection is well-spaced but sufficient. 2. 30m 5c Continue easily and securely to the crux slot. This is awkward and committing: movement is limited by the confines of the slot, and the overlying left wall pushes the climber off balance. Once the move is initiated, there is no going back, as, because it is undercut here, the feet are lost. Move right onto the hanging slab, and more-easily up to the cave. Wriggle through the window to emerge on top. Good belay anchors are to be found just across the neck, looking down into Forked Gully. If it turns out that you are too well-fed to fit through the window (it is quite small), all is not lost: the rock to the left of the cave is climbable. Likewise, if defeated by the crux slot, a traverse right from above the belay will take you to the main gully groove, which is fairly-easily climbable at this point (this was checked on abseil). A note on the grade: The character and challenges of each of the two pitches is so completely different, that coming up with an overall grade is difficult. The technical crux is stiff, but short and well-protected; the first pitch is not technically difficult but might disconcert those unused to such terrain. The grade given attempts to take both these considerations into account. N.B For historical reasons, the routes on the cliff are listed from right (SE) to left (NW) - which is why the route above is the closest to Dreaming Gully."

Widger The following two climbs are on the corner of the right-hand buttress as you enter the above gully. BROKEN DREAMS 18m HS 3c Start 5m Left & 7m higher up of Big Bang Theory Climb obvious crack line for 8m, traverse left for 1.5m (Crux) then up slab section over obvious spikes (good protection) the route then joins into big bang theory. Tat has been placed for abseiling off both routes. BIG BANG THEORY 25m HS 4a Starting 5m right of the entrance to the large gully described in the above climbs on a West facing wall overlooking the main coum. Well protected for the top 18m or so of the climb, Big Bang Theory follows a varied width corner crack for the majority of the route. The crux is at approx 19m and involves exiting the crack/corner. After passing the crux proceed for 6m over a large block to belay. The top belay should be checked for loose rock but the stance is quite spacious and affords great views of the Mahon valley. Abseil descent off large block to gully floor. The following climbs ( Waterfall Slabs, Toadpipe, Raving, Screwtape ) were originally stated as being in Foill an Priosun, but best efforts at locating them place them on the North-East cliff (South-West facing) in Coum Mahon. This is on the basis of identifying and repeating Waterfall Slabs. ***************************************************************** N.B. The following routes are described, in order, from East (right) to West (left). WATERFALL SLABS 46m D The obvious water-worn slabs at the east end of the crag. Start just east of the right hand stream, cross it after about 12m and go up the slabs between the two streams to the top. Conglomerate - fairly sound. TOADPIPE 73m VD This climb is just to the left of the second big grass gully west from the waterfall. The gully is distinguishable by a rock island in its lower part. Start at the foot of a small slabby buttress. 1. 24m. Climb the buttress and scramble up grass to the foot of a wall. Conglomerate - fairly sound. 2. 12m. Climb the wall moving left. , then right to a ledge. Conglomerate - fairly sound. 3. 9m. Climb the wall above the ledge. Go diagonally left. , then move right just below a grass ledge and climb into a recess. Conglomerate - fairly sound. 4. 9m. Pull out of the recess, up rock, and then steep grass to the foot of a chimney in a corner. Conglomerate - fairly sound. The chimney is the logical finish, but it is very loose (sandstone) and the climb was finished as follows - 5. 18m. Traverse left round a corner into a grassy recess and then climb a chimney to easy ground. Sandstone - loose. TOADPIPE DIRECT 71m VS 4b, 4b, 4b, 4c/5a In trying to find the fit between the physical features of this buttress and the written description of Toadpipe , the conclusion is reached that that route follows ‘the line of least resistance’ . At the top, in particular, the only possible match with the loose sandstone chimneys mentioned, is on heather up the scruffy right hand side of the buttress. The Direct route takes an uncompromising line up the centre of the buttress, heading for the large right-facing corner at the top. The climbing is not difficult but the exposure is considerable and protection minimal, including at the belays. 1. 28m 4b A show of intent is given by climbing straight through the overhang halfway up (having placed the first and last protection of the pitch) rather than skirting around it to the left. Continue up heather to the next rock wall. 2. 22m 4b Straight up to a good ledge. 3. 15m 4b To corner. 4. 6m 4c/5a Corner to top. SUPER FLUMINA 82m E1 3c 5a 5b Location: This goes up the centre, to the highest point of the Screwtape/Raving buttress, going straight through some unlikely-looking overhanging territory in its the upper reaches. Start: 20m to the right of the rib of Raving. 1. 30m 3c Scramble up the 45 degree sloping ramp leftwards to a little bay, backed by a clean rock face and a poor belay at its left-hand side. 2. 24m 5a Traverse right atop a thin sheet of soggy vegetation to a wet corner and good anchors. Climb up here, going out from the corner to the arete. Continue up the edge of a large flake, pass behind this, and up another arete to a large grassy ledge. This ledge has been otherwise untroubled by the feet of men or beasts. 3. 28m 5b Climb up from where you arrived at the ledge, being careful not to dislodge the loose blocks near the arete and continue up the grooves above. These grooves are the product of two intersecting sets of vertical joints that here give rise to a series of grooves of about 60 degrees, separated from their neighbours by little aretes of a similar angle, producing, in this part of the cliff only, a columnar appearance to the rock. The first two pitches were climbed on sight. The top 10m of the top pitch was glanced at, but not touched, two years earlier on abseil in a scan of the likely feasibility of the line. RAVING 137m HS Start - To the right of Screwtape 1. Up the obvious rib. 2. Loose rock to a belay in the corner. 3. A steep wall to easier ground. 4. Traverse left and finish up last pitch of Screwtape. (There is a direct finish but it is loose and was not led). SCREWTAPE 79m HS Start - Just right of a deep gully, the third from the waterfall slabs below a big nose. 1. 18m. Up a few feet, then move left onto the nose, up, back R. and straight up to a ledge. (Conglomerate - rotten). 2. 15m. Up the wall on the left, then R. , then L. round the bulge and up easily to the bridge of the nose (Conglomerate - very rotten). 3. 24m. Up grass slopes heading for the L. edge of the big buttress above. Then traverse R. on loose flakes and climb up into the recess, (Sandstone - loose). 4. 21m. Up grass slopes heading for the L. edge of the big buttress above. but for more interest, traverse R. down a grassy ramp, swing round onto a rib, and climb it to the top. (Sandstone). <u>Screwtape Revisited</u> There is evidence, on both sides of the valley for the squeezing of the rocks, at some time, along an axis approximately SE - NW. This is most apparent in the finer-grained layers, resulting in a cleavage at a high angle to the more-or-less horizontal lie of the beds. It can also be seen, though less-well developed in the coarser-grained conglomerate. Screwtape is a good place to observe this! SCREWTAPE REVISITED 80m E1 4c, 4c, Diff, 5b, 5a 1. 18m 4c Good climbing as described. Rock: flaky-looking but, treated with respect, good. 2. 15m 4c As described. Rock quality of initial wall excellent; then a scramble to a little col. 3. 20m Diff. A little bit of easy rock, then grass, then more easy rock and more grass. Rock quality: irrelevant. 4. 20m 5b Go up easily to a little rock wall above a patch of small willows and place some good protection. Then, descend to the right, behind the trees, to the edge of the void. [It might be necessary to pull up one rope and throw it back down, so that it can be clear of the trees.] Edge gingerly across to gain the undercut arete, avoiding some suspect flakes. A couple of moves brings you to a position of remarkable exposure - standing on a small square jutting block, with 60m of fresh air beneath your feet. Go around the arete and make some technical moves to a ledge. Rock quality: excellent. AT THE PITTES BRINKE 65m E1 5a 5b/c 20m to the right of The Line, a moist corner slants across to the left at an angle of 30 degrees to meet an overlap at 10m. 1. 38m 5a Start a couple of metres left of the corner and climb the slab, heading for the junction between corner and overlap. Good protection can be found here for the move through the overlap. On the slab above, follow the left slanting crack until it becomes a small corner and here climb the little arete to grass and gear (30m). Make a rising traverse across grass and woodrush for 8m to a good stance below the square arete. 2. 27m 5b/c climb the arete, mostly on its right hand side to its apex. Then, move boldly right, following a thin curving undercut crack onto the hanging slab. Thin moves but with some good protection, lead up past a fist-sized slot to the top. Abseiled previously to check the availability of protection above the overlap on pitch one and for some cleaning at the overlap. Little or no account was taken of the second pitch. THE LINE 65m E2 5b 5b Location: In the centre of the cliff, mid-way between Jacob’s Ladder and Screwtape. The first pitch climbs the ruler-straight left-facing corner; the second pitch continues up the left side of the light-coloured prow above. 1. 40m 5b. Easy ground, then keep to the slab to the right until you can step left onto the grass pad in the corner. Above, the back wall bulges. Getting up this is the crux and the gear here is small, hard to find and hard to trust but ‘be ye men of valour’ , there are better holds and gear-placements above. Follow the corner to its very end (including the grassy top) to belay immediately below the headwall. 2. 25m 5b Follow the cracks above the belay. Holds and gear placements abound but the wall overhangs slightly making it quite pumpy. The angle eases towards the top. AND I SAW A NEW HEAVEN 68m E1 5a 5b An excellent route with a good variety of climbing. The first pitch may look a little scruffy and ill-defined but the climbing is good and the route makes perfect sense when you are on it. Location: Midway between Jacob’s Ladder and The Line, is a poorly-defined, broken A-shaped buttress, just to the right of the start of Artemis and Apollo; at its base is a clean 8m slab at a comfortable angle. 1. 38m 5a Climb the slab (unprotected) then move left to rough rock. Go up the arete and then the left-slanting corner, then up a steep crack. This leads to a near-vertical grass sheet. Before this is reached, a broken crack joins from the right. Follow this at an easier angle, over vegetation and go up past a square jammed flake of unknown security to belay in a corner beside a patch of furze. 2. 30m 5b From the belay, move out boldly right onto the clean jutting nose. Climb to the top of this (good nuts in a crack) and move to the right into a rectangular recess resembling a door-case, complete with a square-cut lintel making a little roof at the top. Exit left into the generous cleaned groove and continue up into the clean corner above. Go up past the peg to the top of the corner and top out to the right The route was first attempted on 29/4. The first pitch received extensive cleaning with an ice-axe on lead. The second pitch was not amenable to on-sight cleaning and, in its uncleaned state did not seem ‘justifiable’ , and a different (though not easier or safer) line was taken to the left. This was written up at the time as Sicut Cervus E2 5a 5b but can safely be relegated to the position of footnote. The corner and (especially) the groove were cleaned a week later on abseil and, because the climbing seemed thin and the protection seemed lacking, a peg was put in. As it turns out, the peg wasn't really necessary but it is still reassuring for the final crux move topping out. If your ethics or conscience do not allow you to clip it, then don’t . Either way, only God (and your second) will know and no one will care. ARTEMIS 80m E2 5a 5b/c Location: 10m to the right (East) of Unseen Things Above, the first pitch climbs the left-slanting groove between the flake/buttress and the wall behind. (Unseen Things climbs the left edge of this buttress). The groove is vegetated but this is of no consequence since the climbing consists of bridging between the edge of the flake and the clean, solid and delightfully knobbly back wall. The top 25m of the second pitch is superb high-quality climbing on clean rock. 1. 35m 5a. Up a couple of metres of vegetation to reach rock and then the groove. Bridge up this to a grassy belay. 2. 45m 5b/c. From the belay, go up and right over easy ground for 20m towards the (very small) corner in the centre of the face. Where the rock steepens, follow the edge of the triangular flake to the base of the corner . This is marked by a small square plate jutting from a slot. Climb confidently to the top, finding good protection from small nuts for most of the way. APOLLO 80m HVS 5a 4c 1. 35m 5a Pitch 1 of Artemis. 2. 45m 4c From the belay, go up and slightly left towards a stunted (pedunculate-) oak tree. Squirm past this on the right and follow a good edge and crack towards a (scary-looking but actually sound) hanging flake. Pass this on the left to the top. UNSEEN THINGS ABOVE 80m E2 5b 5c 5b Location: Jacob’s Ladder is easily identified by the detached block at its base. The bay to the right (East) of it is defined on its right hand side by an obvious overhanging corner/groove. 1. 30m 5b Climb the groove, exiting right into a good belay nest. 2. 25m 5c From the belay, traverse delicately left for two metres to a narrow grass ledge and follow the crack up to the slot above. Intricate climbing through this leads to a grassy platform. 3. 25m 5b. From the belay, go up and, on the left of the arete, pull strenuously up the flake-crack to a stance and then, to avoid thin suspect flakes, keep left and climb spectacularly up the edge of the thin-but-solid sharp arete to its top. From here, protection can be found in the bottom of the crack to the left, which separates the glass-smooth slab from heathery rock. The top is a few metres up. Walk off from here i.e. below the top band of rock. JACOB'S LADDER 82m HS [original grade - but read to the end] This is a good climb in a good situation. The route climbs the stepped-ladder feature, one third of the way down the crag from Mahon Falls, that forms the right-hand boundary of the large wide-vee gully. The left-hand branch of this gully provides a convenient [if somewhat sketchy] descent. The route starts from a detached boulder. 1. 25m. Climb straight up the face of the rib to grassy top. 2. 35m. Up slab and obvious vee-chimney. Continue up smooth slab to grass ledge. ART THOU ELIAS? 60m VS 4c 4c Location: This is the stepped arete opposite Jacob’s Ladder , across the mouth of the forked gully. It is the next gully right (East) from Dreaming Gully. 1. 20m 4c + 10m to the belay. Start just left of the ‘Plank’ and follow the rough crack which snakes up to a little overhang at the top. Go through the centre of this overhang to a lovely little promontory. 2. 30m Severe, except for one 4c move as described: At the overhanging split nose, move up to the right and make an exciting move onto a small flat foothold just above the overhang on the point of the nose, and continue up the groove. Scramble up to the terrace and descend via Dreaming Gully (Forked Gully not recommended without prior knowledge). SUMMER OF ‘69 63m HVS 4c 4c 4b Location: About 60m right from Dreaming Gully - mid-way between it and Forked Gully - is a dark wet blind gully with a jammed square block. The route starts at the right hand side of this gully. 1. 28m 4c Climb the rib, heading for the corner above. A considered, cautious approach to the rock is indicated for the rib. At the band of vegetation, follow the crack on the left and up heather to belay below the corner. 2. 25m 4c Good climbing up the corner, with good gear. Belay at the comfortable ledge. 3.10m 4b Climb up and to the right towards the attractive face of the overhanging prow and up this easily but spectacularly to belay above. Cross the heather isthmus and up the easy-angled slab to the terrace. CAMEL MEETS NEEDLE 80m E2 4c 5c Location: mid-way between Dreaming Gully and Forked Gully is the blind gully/chimney with the jammed blocks mentioned above. Ten or twelve metres left from this, a scruffy arete slants up to converge at the same point at the top. This arete is an obvious feature and draws the eye as you approach the Falls. 1. 50m 4c Start below the arete, which is undercut at the bottom. Surmount the overhang (gear available below it) to gain the arete. Continue for 50m to the bare rock pillar. Some vegetation must be passed on the journey up. Protection is well-spaced but sufficient. 2. 30m 5c Continue easily and securely to the crux slot. This is awkward and committing: movement is limited by the confines of the slot, and the overlying left wall pushes the climber off balance. Once the move is initiated, there is no going back, as, because it is undercut here, the feet are lost. Move right onto the hanging slab, and more-easily up to the cave. Wriggle through the window to emerge on top. Good belay anchors are to be found just across the neck, looking down into Forked Gully. If it turns out that you are too well-fed to fit through the window (it is quite small), all is not lost: the rock to the left of the cave is climbable. Likewise, if defeated by the crux slot, a traverse right from above the belay will take you to the main gully groove, which is fairly-easily climbable at this point (this was checked on abseil). A note on the grade: The character and challenges of each of the two pitches is so completely different, that coming up with an overall grade is difficult. The technical crux is stiff, but short and well-protected; the first pitch is not technically difficult but might disconcert those unused to such terrain. The grade given attempts to take both these considerations into account. N.B For historical reasons, the routes on the cliff are listed from right (SE) to left (NW) - which is why the route above is the closest to Dreaming Gully."

Start at the foot of a small slabby buttress. 1. 24m. Climb the buttress and scramble up grass to the foot of a wall. Conglomerate - fairly sound. 2. 12m. Climb the wall moving left. , then right to a ledge. Conglomerate - fairly sound. 3. 9m. Climb the wall above the ledge. Go diagonally left. , then move right just below a grass ledge and climb into a recess. Conglomerate - fairly sound. 4. 9m. Pull out of the recess, up rock, and then steep grass to the foot of a chimney in a corner. Conglomerate - fairly sound. The chimney is the logical finish, but it is very loose (sandstone) and the climb was finished as follows - 5. 18m. Traverse left round a corner into a grassy recess and then climb a chimney to easy ground. Sandstone - loose. TOADPIPE DIRECT 71m VS 4b, 4b, 4b, 4c/5a In trying to find the fit between the physical features of this buttress and the written description of Toadpipe , the conclusion is reached that that route follows ‘the line of least resistance’ . At the top, in particular, the only possible match with the loose sandstone chimneys mentioned, is on heather up the scruffy right hand side of the buttress. The Direct route takes an uncompromising line up the centre of the buttress, heading for the large right-facing corner at the top. The climbing is not difficult but the exposure is considerable and protection minimal, including at the belays. 1. 28m 4b A show of intent is given by climbing straight through the overhang halfway up (having placed the first and last protection of the pitch) rather than skirting around it to the left. Continue up heather to the next rock wall. 2. 22m 4b Straight up to a good ledge. 3. 15m 4b To corner. 4. 6m 4c/5a Corner to top. SUPER FLUMINA 82m E1 3c 5a 5b Location: This goes up the centre, to the highest point of the Screwtape/Raving buttress, going straight through some unlikely-looking overhanging territory in its the upper reaches. Start: 20m to the right of the rib of Raving. 1. 30m 3c Scramble up the 45 degree sloping ramp leftwards to a little bay, backed by a clean rock face and a poor belay at its left-hand side. 2. 24m 5a Traverse right atop a thin sheet of soggy vegetation to a wet corner and good anchors. Climb up here, going out from the corner to the arete. Continue up the edge of a large flake, pass behind this, and up another arete to a large grassy ledge. This ledge has been otherwise untroubled by the feet of men or beasts. 3. 28m 5b Climb up from where you arrived at the ledge, being careful not to dislodge the loose blocks near the arete and continue up the grooves above. These grooves are the product of two intersecting sets of vertical joints that here give rise to a series of grooves of about 60 degrees, separated from their neighbours by little aretes of a similar angle, producing, in this part of the cliff only, a columnar appearance to the rock. The first two pitches were climbed on sight. The top 10m of the top pitch was glanced at, but not touched, two years earlier on abseil in a scan of the likely feasibility of the line. RAVING 137m HS Start - To the right of Screwtape 1. Up the obvious rib. 2. Loose rock to a belay in the corner. 3. A steep wall to easier ground. 4. Traverse left and finish up last pitch of Screwtape. (There is a direct finish but it is loose and was not led). SCREWTAPE 79m HS Start - Just right of a deep gully, the third from the waterfall slabs below a big nose. 1. 18m. Up a few feet, then move left onto the nose, up, back R. and straight up to a ledge. (Conglomerate - rotten). 2. 15m. Up the wall on the left, then R. , then L. round the bulge and up easily to the bridge of the nose (Conglomerate - very rotten). 3. 24m. Up grass slopes heading for the L. edge of the big buttress above. Then traverse R. on loose flakes and climb up into the recess, (Sandstone - loose). 4. 21m. Up grass slopes heading for the L. edge of the big buttress above. but for more interest, traverse R. down a grassy ramp, swing round onto a rib, and climb it to the top. (Sandstone). <u>Screwtape Revisited</u> There is evidence, on both sides of the valley for the squeezing of the rocks, at some time, along an axis approximately SE - NW. This is most apparent in the finer-grained layers, resulting in a cleavage at a high angle to the more-or-less horizontal lie of the beds. It can also be seen, though less-well developed in the coarser-grained conglomerate. Screwtape is a good place to observe this! SCREWTAPE REVISITED 80m E1 4c, 4c, Diff, 5b, 5a 1. 18m 4c Good climbing as described. Rock: flaky-looking but, treated with respect, good. 2. 15m 4c As described. Rock quality of initial wall excellent; then a scramble to a little col. 3. 20m Diff. A little bit of easy rock, then grass, then more easy rock and more grass. Rock quality: irrelevant. 4. 20m 5b Go up easily to a little rock wall above a patch of small willows and place some good protection. Then, descend to the right, behind the trees, to the edge of the void. [It might be necessary to pull up one rope and throw it back down, so that it can be clear of the trees.] Edge gingerly across to gain the undercut arete, avoiding some suspect flakes. A couple of moves brings you to a position of remarkable exposure - standing on a small square jutting block, with 60m of fresh air beneath your feet. Go around the arete and make some technical moves to a ledge. Rock quality: excellent. AT THE PITTES BRINKE 65m E1 5a 5b/c 20m to the right of The Line, a moist corner slants across to the left at an angle of 30 degrees to meet an overlap at 10m. 1. 38m 5a Start a couple of metres left of the corner and climb the slab, heading for the junction between corner and overlap. Good protection can be found here for the move through the overlap. On the slab above, follow the left slanting crack until it becomes a small corner and here climb the little arete to grass and gear (30m). Make a rising traverse across grass and woodrush for 8m to a good stance below the square arete. 2. 27m 5b/c climb the arete, mostly on its right hand side to its apex. Then, move boldly right, following a thin curving undercut crack onto the hanging slab. Thin moves but with some good protection, lead up past a fist-sized slot to the top. Abseiled previously to check the availability of protection above the overlap on pitch one and for some cleaning at the overlap. Little or no account was taken of the second pitch. THE LINE 65m E2 5b 5b Location: In the centre of the cliff, mid-way between Jacob’s Ladder and Screwtape. The first pitch climbs the ruler-straight left-facing corner; the second pitch continues up the left side of the light-coloured prow above. 1. 40m 5b. Easy ground, then keep to the slab to the right until you can step left onto the grass pad in the corner. Above, the back wall bulges. Getting up this is the crux and the gear here is small, hard to find and hard to trust but ‘be ye men of valour’ , there are better holds and gear-placements above. Follow the corner to its very end (including the grassy top) to belay immediately below the headwall. 2. 25m 5b Follow the cracks above the belay. Holds and gear placements abound but the wall overhangs slightly making it quite pumpy. The angle eases towards the top. AND I SAW A NEW HEAVEN 68m E1 5a 5b An excellent route with a good variety of climbing. The first pitch may look a little scruffy and ill-defined but the climbing is good and the route makes perfect sense when you are on it. Location: Midway between Jacob’s Ladder and The Line, is a poorly-defined, broken A-shaped buttress, just to the right of the start of Artemis and Apollo; at its base is a clean 8m slab at a comfortable angle. 1. 38m 5a Climb the slab (unprotected) then move left to rough rock. Go up the arete and then the left-slanting corner, then up a steep crack. This leads to a near-vertical grass sheet. Before this is reached, a broken crack joins from the right. Follow this at an easier angle, over vegetation and go up past a square jammed flake of unknown security to belay in a corner beside a patch of furze. 2. 30m 5b From the belay, move out boldly right onto the clean jutting nose. Climb to the top of this (good nuts in a crack) and move to the right into a rectangular recess resembling a door-case, complete with a square-cut lintel making a little roof at the top. Exit left into the generous cleaned groove and continue up into the clean corner above. Go up past the peg to the top of the corner and top out to the right The route was first attempted on 29/4. The first pitch received extensive cleaning with an ice-axe on lead. The second pitch was not amenable to on-sight cleaning and, in its uncleaned state did not seem ‘justifiable’ , and a different (though not easier or safer) line was taken to the left. This was written up at the time as Sicut Cervus E2 5a 5b but can safely be relegated to the position of footnote. The corner and (especially) the groove were cleaned a week later on abseil and, because the climbing seemed thin and the protection seemed lacking, a peg was put in. As it turns out, the peg wasn't really necessary but it is still reassuring for the final crux move topping out. If your ethics or conscience do not allow you to clip it, then don’t . Either way, only God (and your second) will know and no one will care. ARTEMIS 80m E2 5a 5b/c Location: 10m to the right (East) of Unseen Things Above, the first pitch climbs the left-slanting groove between the flake/buttress and the wall behind. (Unseen Things climbs the left edge of this buttress). The groove is vegetated but this is of no consequence since the climbing consists of bridging between the edge of the flake and the clean, solid and delightfully knobbly back wall. The top 25m of the second pitch is superb high-quality climbing on clean rock. 1. 35m 5a. Up a couple of metres of vegetation to reach rock and then the groove. Bridge up this to a grassy belay. 2. 45m 5b/c. From the belay, go up and right over easy ground for 20m towards the (very small) corner in the centre of the face. Where the rock steepens, follow the edge of the triangular flake to the base of the corner . This is marked by a small square plate jutting from a slot. Climb confidently to the top, finding good protection from small nuts for most of the way. APOLLO 80m HVS 5a 4c 1. 35m 5a Pitch 1 of Artemis. 2. 45m 4c From the belay, go up and slightly left towards a stunted (pedunculate-) oak tree. Squirm past this on the right and follow a good edge and crack towards a (scary-looking but actually sound) hanging flake. Pass this on the left to the top. UNSEEN THINGS ABOVE 80m E2 5b 5c 5b Location: Jacob’s Ladder is easily identified by the detached block at its base. The bay to the right (East) of it is defined on its right hand side by an obvious overhanging corner/groove. 1. 30m 5b Climb the groove, exiting right into a good belay nest. 2. 25m 5c From the belay, traverse delicately left for two metres to a narrow grass ledge and follow the crack up to the slot above. Intricate climbing through this leads to a grassy platform. 3. 25m 5b. From the belay, go up and, on the left of the arete, pull strenuously up the flake-crack to a stance and then, to avoid thin suspect flakes, keep left and climb spectacularly up the edge of the thin-but-solid sharp arete to its top. From here, protection can be found in the bottom of the crack to the left, which separates the glass-smooth slab from heathery rock. The top is a few metres up. Walk off from here i.e. below the top band of rock. JACOB'S LADDER 82m HS [original grade - but read to the end] This is a good climb in a good situation. The route climbs the stepped-ladder feature, one third of the way down the crag from Mahon Falls, that forms the right-hand boundary of the large wide-vee gully. The left-hand branch of this gully provides a convenient [if somewhat sketchy] descent. The route starts from a detached boulder. 1. 25m. Climb straight up the face of the rib to grassy top. 2. 35m. Up slab and obvious vee-chimney. Continue up smooth slab to grass ledge. ART THOU ELIAS? 60m VS 4c 4c Location: This is the stepped arete opposite Jacob’s Ladder , across the mouth of the forked gully. It is the next gully right (East) from Dreaming Gully. 1. 20m 4c + 10m to the belay. Start just left of the ‘Plank’ and follow the rough crack which snakes up to a little overhang at the top. Go through the centre of this overhang to a lovely little promontory. 2. 30m Severe, except for one 4c move as described: At the overhanging split nose, move up to the right and make an exciting move onto a small flat foothold just above the overhang on the point of the nose, and continue up the groove. Scramble up to the terrace and descend via Dreaming Gully (Forked Gully not recommended without prior knowledge). SUMMER OF ‘69 63m HVS 4c 4c 4b Location: About 60m right from Dreaming Gully - mid-way between it and Forked Gully - is a dark wet blind gully with a jammed square block. The route starts at the right hand side of this gully. 1. 28m 4c Climb the rib, heading for the corner above. A considered, cautious approach to the rock is indicated for the rib. At the band of vegetation, follow the crack on the left and up heather to belay below the corner. 2. 25m 4c Good climbing up the corner, with good gear. Belay at the comfortable ledge. 3.10m 4b Climb up and to the right towards the attractive face of the overhanging prow and up this easily but spectacularly to belay above. Cross the heather isthmus and up the easy-angled slab to the terrace. CAMEL MEETS NEEDLE 80m E2 4c 5c Location: mid-way between Dreaming Gully and Forked Gully is the blind gully/chimney with the jammed blocks mentioned above. Ten or twelve metres left from this, a scruffy arete slants up to converge at the same point at the top. This arete is an obvious feature and draws the eye as you approach the Falls. 1. 50m 4c Start below the arete, which is undercut at the bottom. Surmount the overhang (gear available below it) to gain the arete. Continue for 50m to the bare rock pillar. Some vegetation must be passed on the journey up. Protection is well-spaced but sufficient. 2. 30m 5c Continue easily and securely to the crux slot. This is awkward and committing: movement is limited by the confines of the slot, and the overlying left wall pushes the climber off balance. Once the move is initiated, there is no going back, as, because it is undercut here, the feet are lost. Move right onto the hanging slab, and more-easily up to the cave. Wriggle through the window to emerge on top. Good belay anchors are to be found just across the neck, looking down into Forked Gully. If it turns out that you are too well-fed to fit through the window (it is quite small), all is not lost: the rock to the left of the cave is climbable. Likewise, if defeated by the crux slot, a traverse right from above the belay will take you to the main gully groove, which is fairly-easily climbable at this point (this was checked on abseil). A note on the grade: The character and challenges of each of the two pitches is so completely different, that coming up with an overall grade is difficult. The technical crux is stiff, but short and well-protected; the first pitch is not technically difficult but might disconcert those unused to such terrain. The grade given attempts to take both these considerations into account. N.B For historical reasons, the routes on the cliff are listed from right (SE) to left (NW) - which is why the route above is the closest to Dreaming Gully."

Tat has been placed for abseiling off both routes. BIG BANG THEORY 25m HS 4a Starting 5m right of the entrance to the large gully described in the above climbs on a West facing wall overlooking the main coum. Well protected for the top 18m or so of the climb, Big Bang Theory follows a varied width corner crack for the majority of the route. The crux is at approx 19m and involves exiting the crack/corner. After passing the crux proceed for 6m over a large block to belay. The top belay should be checked for loose rock but the stance is quite spacious and affords great views of the Mahon valley. Abseil descent off large block to gully floor. The following climbs ( Waterfall Slabs, Toadpipe, Raving, Screwtape ) were originally stated as being in Foill an Priosun, but best efforts at locating them place them on the North-East cliff (South-West facing) in Coum Mahon. This is on the basis of identifying and repeating Waterfall Slabs. ***************************************************************** N.B. The following routes are described, in order, from East (right) to West (left). WATERFALL SLABS 46m D The obvious water-worn slabs at the east end of the crag. Start just east of the right hand stream, cross it after about 12m and go up the slabs between the two streams to the top. Conglomerate - fairly sound. TOADPIPE 73m VD This climb is just to the left of the second big grass gully west from the waterfall. The gully is distinguishable by a rock island in its lower part. Start at the foot of a small slabby buttress. 1. 24m. Climb the buttress and scramble up grass to the foot of a wall. Conglomerate - fairly sound. 2. 12m.

Pull out of the recess, up rock, and then steep grass to the foot of a chimney in a corner. Conglomerate - fairly sound. The chimney is the logical finish, but it is very loose (sandstone) and the climb was finished as follows - 5. 18m.

SUPER FLUMINA 82m E1 3c 5a 5b Location: This goes up the centre, to the highest point of the Screwtape/Raving buttress, going straight through some unlikely-looking overhanging territory in its the upper reaches. Start: 20m to the right of the rib of Raving. 1. 30m 3c Scramble up the 45 degree sloping ramp leftwards to a little bay, backed by a clean rock face and a poor belay at its left-hand side. 2. 24m 5a Traverse right atop a thin sheet of soggy vegetation to a wet corner and good anchors. Climb up here, going out from the corner to the arete. Continue up the edge of a large flake, pass behind this, and up another arete to a large grassy ledge.

SCREWTAPE REVISITED 80m E1 4c, 4c, Diff, 5b, 5a 1. 18m 4c Good climbing as described. Rock: flaky-looking but, treated with respect, good. 2. 15m 4c As described. Rock quality of initial wall excellent; then a scramble to a little col. 3. 20m Diff. A little bit of easy rock, then grass, then more easy rock and more grass.

AT THE PITTES BRINKE 65m E1 5a 5b/c 20m to the right of The Line, a moist corner slants across to the left at an angle of 30 degrees to meet an overlap at 10m. 1. 38m 5a Start a couple of metres left of the corner and climb the slab, heading for the junction between corner and overlap. Good protection can be found here for the move through the overlap. On the slab above, follow the left slanting crack until it becomes a small corner and here climb the little arete to grass and gear (30m). Make a rising traverse across grass and woodrush for 8m to a good stance below the square arete. 2. 27m 5b/c climb the arete, mostly on its right hand side to its apex. Then, move boldly right, following a thin curving undercut crack onto the hanging slab. Thin moves but with some good protection, lead up past a fist-sized slot to the top. Abseiled previously to check the availability of protection above the overlap on pitch one and for some cleaning at the overlap. Little or no account was taken of the second pitch. THE LINE 65m E2 5b 5b Location: In the centre of the cliff, mid-way between Jacob’s Ladder and Screwtape. The first pitch climbs the ruler-straight left-facing corner; the second pitch continues up the left side of the light-coloured prow above. 1. 40m 5b. Easy ground, then keep to the slab to the right until you can step left onto the grass pad in the corner. Above, the back wall bulges. Getting up this is the crux and the gear here is small, hard to find and hard to trust but ‘be ye men of valour’ , there are better holds and gear-placements above. Follow the corner to its very end (including the grassy top) to belay immediately below the headwall. 2. 25m 5b Follow the cracks above the belay. Holds and gear placements abound but the wall overhangs slightly making it quite pumpy. The angle eases towards the top. AND I SAW A NEW HEAVEN 68m E1 5a 5b An excellent route with a good variety of climbing. The first pitch may look a little scruffy and ill-defined but the climbing is good and the route makes perfect sense when you are on it. Location: Midway between Jacob’s Ladder and The Line, is a poorly-defined, broken A-shaped buttress, just to the right of the start of Artemis and Apollo; at its base is a clean 8m slab at a comfortable angle. 1. 38m 5a Climb the slab (unprotected) then move left to rough rock. Go up the arete and then the left-slanting corner, then up a steep crack. This leads to a near-vertical grass sheet. Before this is reached, a broken crack joins from the right. Follow this at an easier angle, over vegetation and go up past a square jammed flake of unknown security to belay in a corner beside a patch of furze. 2. 30m 5b From the belay, move out boldly right onto the clean jutting nose. Climb to the top of this (good nuts in a crack) and move to the right into a rectangular recess resembling a door-case, complete with a square-cut lintel making a little roof at the top. Exit left into the generous cleaned groove and continue up into the clean corner above. Go up past the peg to the top of the corner and top out to the right The route was first attempted on 29/4. The first pitch received extensive cleaning with an ice-axe on lead. The second pitch was not amenable to on-sight cleaning and, in its uncleaned state did not seem ‘justifiable’ , and a different (though not easier or safer) line was taken to the left. This was written up at the time as Sicut Cervus E2 5a 5b but can safely be relegated to the position of footnote.

As it turns out, the peg wasn't really necessary but it is still reassuring for the final crux move topping out. If your ethics or conscience do not allow you to clip it, then don’t . Either way, only God (and your second) will know and no one will care. ARTEMIS 80m E2 5a 5b/c Location: 10m to the right (East) of Unseen Things Above, the first pitch climbs the left-slanting groove between the flake/buttress and the wall behind. (Unseen Things climbs the left edge of this buttress). The groove is vegetated but this is of no consequence since the climbing consists of bridging between the edge of the flake and the clean, solid and delightfully knobbly back wall. The top 25m of the second pitch is superb high-quality climbing on clean rock. 1. 35m 5a. Up a couple of metres of vegetation to reach rock and then the groove. Bridge up this to a grassy belay. 2. 45m 5b/c. From the belay, go up and right over easy ground for 20m towards the (very small) corner in the centre of the face. Where the rock steepens, follow the edge of the triangular flake to the base of the corner . This is marked by a small square plate jutting from a slot. Climb confidently to the top, finding good protection from small nuts for most of the way. APOLLO 80m HVS 5a 4c 1. 35m 5a Pitch 1 of Artemis. 2. 45m 4c From the belay, go up and slightly left towards a stunted (pedunculate-) oak tree. Squirm past this on the right and follow a good edge and crack towards a (scary-looking but actually sound) hanging flake. Pass this on the left to the top. UNSEEN THINGS ABOVE 80m E2 5b 5c 5b Location: Jacob’s Ladder is easily identified by the detached block at its base. The bay to the right (East) of it is defined on its right hand side by an obvious overhanging corner/groove. 1. 30m 5b Climb the groove, exiting right into a good belay nest. 2. 25m 5c From the belay, traverse delicately left for two metres to a narrow grass ledge and follow the crack up to the slot above. Intricate climbing through this leads to a grassy platform. 3. 25m 5b. From the belay, go up and, on the left of the arete, pull strenuously up the flake-crack to a stance and then, to avoid thin suspect flakes, keep left and climb spectacularly up the edge of the thin-but-solid sharp arete to its top. From here, protection can be found in the bottom of the crack to the left, which separates the glass-smooth slab from heathery rock. The top is a few metres up. Walk off from here i.e. below the top band of rock. JACOB'S LADDER 82m HS [original grade - but read to the end] This is a good climb in a good situation. The route climbs the stepped-ladder feature, one third of the way down the crag from Mahon Falls, that forms the right-hand boundary of the large wide-vee gully. The left-hand branch of this gully provides a convenient [if somewhat sketchy] descent. The route starts from a detached boulder. 1. 25m. Climb straight up the face of the rib to grassy top. 2. 35m. Up slab and obvious vee-chimney. Continue up smooth slab to grass ledge. ART THOU ELIAS? 60m VS 4c 4c Location: This is the stepped arete opposite Jacob’s Ladder , across the mouth of the forked gully. It is the next gully right (East) from Dreaming Gully. 1. 20m 4c + 10m to the belay. Start just left of the ‘Plank’ and follow the rough crack which snakes up to a little overhang at the top. Go through the centre of this overhang to a lovely little promontory. 2. 30m Severe, except for one 4c move as described: At the overhanging split nose, move up to the right and make an exciting move onto a small flat foothold just above the overhang on the point of the nose, and continue up the groove. Scramble up to the terrace and descend via Dreaming Gully (Forked Gully not recommended without prior knowledge). SUMMER OF ‘69 63m HVS 4c 4c 4b Location: About 60m right from Dreaming Gully - mid-way between it and Forked Gully - is a dark wet blind gully with a jammed square block. The route starts at the right hand side of this gully. 1. 28m 4c Climb the rib, heading for the corner above. A considered, cautious approach to the rock is indicated for the rib. At the band of vegetation, follow the crack on the left and up heather to belay below the corner. 2. 25m 4c Good climbing up the corner, with good gear. Belay at the comfortable ledge. 3.10m 4b Climb up and to the right towards the attractive face of the overhanging prow and up this easily but spectacularly to belay above. Cross the heather isthmus and up the easy-angled slab to the terrace. CAMEL MEETS NEEDLE 80m E2 4c 5c Location: mid-way between Dreaming Gully and Forked Gully is the blind gully/chimney with the jammed blocks mentioned above. Ten or twelve metres left from this, a scruffy arete slants up to converge at the same point at the top. This arete is an obvious feature and draws the eye as you approach the Falls. 1. 50m 4c Start below the arete, which is undercut at the bottom. Surmount the overhang (gear available below it) to gain the arete. Continue for 50m to the bare rock pillar. Some vegetation must be passed on the journey up. Protection is well-spaced but sufficient. 2. 30m 5c Continue easily and securely to the crux slot. This is awkward and committing: movement is limited by the confines of the slot, and the overlying left wall pushes the climber off balance. Once the move is initiated, there is no going back, as, because it is undercut here, the feet are lost. Move right onto the hanging slab, and more-easily up to the cave. Wriggle through the window to emerge on top. Good belay anchors are to be found just across the neck, looking down into Forked Gully. If it turns out that you are too well-fed to fit through the window (it is quite small), all is not lost: the rock to the left of the cave is climbable. Likewise, if defeated by the crux slot, a traverse right from above the belay will take you to the main gully groove, which is fairly-easily climbable at this point (this was checked on abseil). A note on the grade: The character and challenges of each of the two pitches is so completely different, that coming up with an overall grade is difficult. The technical crux is stiff, but short and well-protected; the first pitch is not technically difficult but might disconcert those unused to such terrain. The grade given attempts to take both these considerations into account. N.B For historical reasons, the routes on the cliff are listed from right (SE) to left (NW) - which is why the route above is the closest to Dreaming Gully."

            "description": "Starting 5m right of the entrance to the large gully described in the above climbs on a West facing wall overlooking the main coum. Well protected for the top 18m or so of the climb, Big Bang Theory follows a varied width corner crack for the majority of the route. The crux is at approx 19m and involves exiting the crack/corner. After passing the crux proceed for 6m over a large block to belay. The top belay should be checked for loose rock but the stance is quite spacious and affords great views of the Mahon valley. Abseil descent off large block to gully floor. The following climbs ( Waterfall Slabs, Toadpipe, Raving, Screwtape ) were originally stated as being in Foill an Priosun, but best efforts at locating them place them on the North-East cliff (South-West facing) in Coum Mahon. This is on the basis of identifying and repeating Waterfall Slabs. ***************************************************************** N.B. The following routes are described, in order, from East (right) to West (left). WATERFALL SLABS 46m D The obvious water-worn slabs at the east end of the crag. Start just east of the right hand stream, cross it after about 12m and go up the slabs between the two streams to the top. Conglomerate - fairly sound. TOADPIPE 73m VD This climb is just to the left of the second big grass gully west from the waterfall. The gully is distinguishable by a rock island in its lower part. Start at the foot of a small slabby buttress. 1. 24m. Climb the buttress and scramble up grass to the foot of a wall. Conglomerate - fairly sound. 2. 12m. Climb the wall moving left. , then right to a ledge. Conglomerate - fairly sound. 3. 9m. Climb the wall above the ledge. Go diagonally left. , then move right just below a grass ledge and climb into a recess. Conglomerate - fairly sound. 4. 9m. Pull out of the recess, up rock, and then steep grass to the foot of a chimney in a corner. Conglomerate - fairly sound. The chimney is the logical finish, but it is very loose (sandstone) and the climb was finished as follows - 5. 18m. Traverse left round a corner into a grassy recess and then climb a chimney to easy ground. Sandstone - loose. TOADPIPE DIRECT 71m VS 4b, 4b, 4b, 4c/5a In trying to find the fit between the physical features of this buttress and the written description of Toadpipe , the conclusion is reached that that route follows ‘the line of least resistance’ . At the top, in particular, the only possible match with the loose sandstone chimneys mentioned, is on heather up the scruffy right hand side of the buttress. The Direct route takes an uncompromising line up the centre of the buttress, heading for the large right-facing corner at the top. The climbing is not difficult but the exposure is considerable and protection minimal, including at the belays. 1. 28m 4b A show of intent is given by climbing straight through the overhang halfway up (having placed the first and last protection of the pitch) rather than skirting around it to the left. Continue up heather to the next rock wall. 2. 22m 4b Straight up to a good ledge. 3. 15m 4b To corner. 4. 6m 4c/5a Corner to top. SUPER FLUMINA 82m E1 3c 5a 5b Location: This goes up the centre, to the highest point of the Screwtape/Raving buttress, going straight through some unlikely-looking overhanging territory in its the upper reaches. Start: 20m to the right of the rib of Raving. 1. 30m 3c Scramble up the 45 degree sloping ramp leftwards to a little bay, backed by a clean rock face and a poor belay at its left-hand side. 2. 24m 5a Traverse right atop a thin sheet of soggy vegetation to a wet corner and good anchors. Climb up here, going out from the corner to the arete. Continue up the edge of a large flake, pass behind this, and up another arete to a large grassy ledge. This ledge has been otherwise untroubled by the feet of men or beasts. 3. 28m 5b Climb up from where you arrived at the ledge, being careful not to dislodge the loose blocks near the arete and continue up the grooves above. These grooves are the product of two intersecting sets of vertical joints that here give rise to a series of grooves of about 60 degrees, separated from their neighbours by little aretes of a similar angle, producing, in this part of the cliff only, a columnar appearance to the rock. The first two pitches were climbed on sight. The top 10m of the top pitch was glanced at, but not touched, two years earlier on abseil in a scan of the likely feasibility of the line. RAVING 137m HS Start - To the right of Screwtape 1. Up the obvious rib. 2. Loose rock to a belay in the corner. 3. A steep wall to easier ground. 4. Traverse left and finish up last pitch of Screwtape. (There is a direct finish but it is loose and was not led). SCREWTAPE 79m HS Start - Just right of a deep gully, the third from the waterfall slabs below a big nose. 1. 18m. Up a few feet, then move left onto the nose, up, back R. and straight up to a ledge. (Conglomerate - rotten). 2. 15m. Up the wall on the left, then R. , then L. round the bulge and up easily to the bridge of the nose (Conglomerate - very rotten). 3. 24m. Up grass slopes heading for the L. edge of the big buttress above. Then traverse R. on loose flakes and climb up into the recess, (Sandstone - loose). 4. 21m. Up grass slopes heading for the L. edge of the big buttress above. but for more interest, traverse R. down a grassy ramp, swing round onto a rib, and climb it to the top. (Sandstone). <u>Screwtape Revisited</u> There is evidence, on both sides of the valley for the squeezing of the rocks, at some time, along an axis approximately SE - NW. This is most apparent in the finer-grained layers, resulting in a cleavage at a high angle to the more-or-less horizontal lie of the beds. It can also be seen, though less-well developed in the coarser-grained conglomerate. Screwtape is a good place to observe this! SCREWTAPE REVISITED 80m E1 4c, 4c, Diff, 5b, 5a 1. 18m 4c Good climbing as described. Rock: flaky-looking but, treated with respect, good. 2. 15m 4c As described. Rock quality of initial wall excellent; then a scramble to a little col. 3. 20m Diff. A little bit of easy rock, then grass, then more easy rock and more grass. Rock quality: irrelevant. 4. 20m 5b Go up easily to a little rock wall above a patch of small willows and place some good protection. Then, descend to the right, behind the trees, to the edge of the void. [It might be necessary to pull up one rope and throw it back down, so that it can be clear of the trees.] Edge gingerly across to gain the undercut arete, avoiding some suspect flakes. A couple of moves brings you to a position of remarkable exposure - standing on a small square jutting block, with 60m of fresh air beneath your feet. Go around the arete and make some technical moves to a ledge. Rock quality: excellent. AT THE PITTES BRINKE 65m E1 5a 5b/c 20m to the right of The Line, a moist corner slants across to the left at an angle of 30 degrees to meet an overlap at 10m. 1. 38m 5a Start a couple of metres left of the corner and climb the slab, heading for the junction between corner and overlap. Good protection can be found here for the move through the overlap. On the slab above, follow the left slanting crack until it becomes a small corner and here climb the little arete to grass and gear (30m). Make a rising traverse across grass and woodrush for 8m to a good stance below the square arete. 2. 27m 5b/c climb the arete, mostly on its right hand side to its apex. Then, move boldly right, following a thin curving undercut crack onto the hanging slab. Thin moves but with some good protection, lead up past a fist-sized slot to the top. Abseiled previously to check the availability of protection above the overlap on pitch one and for some cleaning at the overlap. Little or no account was taken of the second pitch. THE LINE 65m E2 5b 5b Location: In the centre of the cliff, mid-way between Jacob’s Ladder and Screwtape. The first pitch climbs the ruler-straight left-facing corner; the second pitch continues up the left side of the light-coloured prow above. 1. 40m 5b. Easy ground, then keep to the slab to the right until you can step left onto the grass pad in the corner. Above, the back wall bulges. Getting up this is the crux and the gear here is small, hard to find and hard to trust but ‘be ye men of valour’ , there are better holds and gear-placements above. Follow the corner to its very end (including the grassy top) to belay immediately below the headwall. 2. 25m 5b Follow the cracks above the belay. Holds and gear placements abound but the wall overhangs slightly making it quite pumpy. The angle eases towards the top. AND I SAW A NEW HEAVEN 68m E1 5a 5b An excellent route with a good variety of climbing. The first pitch may look a little scruffy and ill-defined but the climbing is good and the route makes perfect sense when you are on it. Location: Midway between Jacob’s Ladder and The Line, is a poorly-defined, broken A-shaped buttress, just to the right of the start of Artemis and Apollo; at its base is a clean 8m slab at a comfortable angle. 1. 38m 5a Climb the slab (unprotected) then move left to rough rock. Go up the arete and then the left-slanting corner, then up a steep crack. This leads to a near-vertical grass sheet. Before this is reached, a broken crack joins from the right. Follow this at an easier angle, over vegetation and go up past a square jammed flake of unknown security to belay in a corner beside a patch of furze. 2. 30m 5b From the belay, move out boldly right onto the clean jutting nose. Climb to the top of this (good nuts in a crack) and move to the right into a rectangular recess resembling a door-case, complete with a square-cut lintel making a little roof at the top. Exit left into the generous cleaned groove and continue up into the clean corner above. Go up past the peg to the top of the corner and top out to the right The route was first attempted on 29/4. The first pitch received extensive cleaning with an ice-axe on lead. The second pitch was not amenable to on-sight cleaning and, in its uncleaned state did not seem ‘justifiable’ , and a different (though not easier or safer) line was taken to the left. This was written up at the time as Sicut Cervus E2 5a 5b but can safely be relegated to the position of footnote. The corner and (especially) the groove were cleaned a week later on abseil and, because the climbing seemed thin and the protection seemed lacking, a peg was put in. As it turns out, the peg wasn't really necessary but it is still reassuring for the final crux move topping out. If your ethics or conscience do not allow you to clip it, then don’t . Either way, only God (and your second) will know and no one will care. ARTEMIS 80m E2 5a 5b/c Location: 10m to the right (East) of Unseen Things Above, the first pitch climbs the left-slanting groove between the flake/buttress and the wall behind. (Unseen Things climbs the left edge of this buttress). The groove is vegetated but this is of no consequence since the climbing consists of bridging between the edge of the flake and the clean, solid and delightfully knobbly back wall. The top 25m of the second pitch is superb high-quality climbing on clean rock. 1. 35m 5a. Up a couple of metres of vegetation to reach rock and then the groove. Bridge up this to a grassy belay. 2. 45m 5b/c. From the belay, go up and right over easy ground for 20m towards the (very small) corner in the centre of the face. Where the rock steepens, follow the edge of the triangular flake to the base of the corner . This is marked by a small square plate jutting from a slot. Climb confidently to the top, finding good protection from small nuts for most of the way. APOLLO 80m HVS 5a 4c 1. 35m 5a Pitch 1 of Artemis. 2. 45m 4c From the belay, go up and slightly left towards a stunted (pedunculate-) oak tree. Squirm past this on the right and follow a good edge and crack towards a (scary-looking but actually sound) hanging flake. Pass this on the left to the top. UNSEEN THINGS ABOVE 80m E2 5b 5c 5b Location: Jacob’s Ladder is easily identified by the detached block at its base. The bay to the right (East) of it is defined on its right hand side by an obvious overhanging corner/groove. 1. 30m 5b Climb the groove, exiting right into a good belay nest. 2. 25m 5c From the belay, traverse delicately left for two metres to a narrow grass ledge and follow the crack up to the slot above. Intricate climbing through this leads to a grassy platform. 3. 25m 5b. From the belay, go up and, on the left of the arete, pull strenuously up the flake-crack to a stance and then, to avoid thin suspect flakes, keep left and climb spectacularly up the edge of the thin-but-solid sharp arete to its top. From here, protection can be found in the bottom of the crack to the left, which separates the glass-smooth slab from heathery rock. The top is a few metres up. Walk off from here i.e. below the top band of rock. JACOB'S LADDER 82m HS [original grade - but read to the end] This is a good climb in a good situation. The route climbs the stepped-ladder feature, one third of the way down the crag from Mahon Falls, that forms the right-hand boundary of the large wide-vee gully. The left-hand branch of this gully provides a convenient [if somewhat sketchy] descent. The route starts from a detached boulder. 1. 25m. Climb straight up the face of the rib to grassy top. 2. 35m. Up slab and obvious vee-chimney. Continue up smooth slab to grass ledge. ART THOU ELIAS? 60m VS 4c 4c Location: This is the stepped arete opposite Jacob’s Ladder , across the mouth of the forked gully. It is the next gully right (East) from Dreaming Gully. 1. 20m 4c + 10m to the belay. Start just left of the ‘Plank’ and follow the rough crack which snakes up to a little overhang at the top. Go through the centre of this overhang to a lovely little promontory. 2. 30m Severe, except for one 4c move as described: At the overhanging split nose, move up to the right and make an exciting move onto a small flat foothold just above the overhang on the point of the nose, and continue up the groove. Scramble up to the terrace and descend via Dreaming Gully (Forked Gully not recommended without prior knowledge). SUMMER OF ‘69 63m HVS 4c 4c 4b Location: About 60m right from Dreaming Gully - mid-way between it and Forked Gully - is a dark wet blind gully with a jammed square block. The route starts at the right hand side of this gully. 1. 28m 4c Climb the rib, heading for the corner above. A considered, cautious approach to the rock is indicated for the rib. At the band of vegetation, follow the crack on the left and up heather to belay below the corner. 2. 25m 4c Good climbing up the corner, with good gear. Belay at the comfortable ledge. 3.10m 4b Climb up and to the right towards the attractive face of the overhanging prow and up this easily but spectacularly to belay above. Cross the heather isthmus and up the easy-angled slab to the terrace. CAMEL MEETS NEEDLE 80m E2 4c 5c Location: mid-way between Dreaming Gully and Forked Gully is the blind gully/chimney with the jammed blocks mentioned above. Ten or twelve metres left from this, a scruffy arete slants up to converge at the same point at the top. This arete is an obvious feature and draws the eye as you approach the Falls. 1. 50m 4c Start below the arete, which is undercut at the bottom. Surmount the overhang (gear available below it) to gain the arete. Continue for 50m to the bare rock pillar. Some vegetation must be passed on the journey up. Protection is well-spaced but sufficient. 2. 30m 5c Continue easily and securely to the crux slot. This is awkward and committing: movement is limited by the confines of the slot, and the overlying left wall pushes the climber off balance. Once the move is initiated, there is no going back, as, because it is undercut here, the feet are lost. Move right onto the hanging slab, and more-easily up to the cave. Wriggle through the window to emerge on top. Good belay anchors are to be found just across the neck, looking down into Forked Gully. If it turns out that you are too well-fed to fit through the window (it is quite small), all is not lost: the rock to the left of the cave is climbable. Likewise, if defeated by the crux slot, a traverse right from above the belay will take you to the main gully groove, which is fairly-easily climbable at this point (this was checked on abseil). A note on the grade: The character and challenges of each of the two pitches is so completely different, that coming up with an overall grade is difficult. The technical crux is stiff, but short and well-protected; the first pitch is not technically difficult but might disconcert those unused to such terrain. The grade given attempts to take both these considerations into account.

Location: Midway between Jacob’s Ladder and The Line, is a poorly-defined, broken A-shaped buttress, just to the right of the start of Artemis and Apollo; at its base is a clean 8m slab at a comfortable angle. 1. 38m 5a Climb the slab (unprotected) then move left to rough rock. Go up the arete and then the left-slanting corner, then up a steep crack. This leads to a near-vertical grass sheet. Before this is reached, a broken crack joins from the right. Follow this at an easier angle, over vegetation and go up past a square jammed flake of unknown security to belay in a corner beside a patch of furze. 2. 30m 5b From the belay, move out boldly right onto the clean jutting nose. Climb to the top of this (good nuts in a crack) and move to the right into a rectangular recess resembling a door-case, complete with a square-cut lintel making a little roof at the top. Exit left into the generous cleaned groove and continue up into the clean corner above. Go up past the peg to the top of the corner and top out to the right The route was first attempted on 29/4. The first pitch received extensive cleaning with an ice-axe on lead. The second pitch was not amenable to on-sight cleaning and, in its uncleaned state did not seem ‘justifiable’ , and a different (though not easier or safer) line was taken to the left. This was written up at the time as Sicut Cervus E2 5a 5b but can safely be relegated to the position of footnote. The corner and (especially) the groove were cleaned a week later on abseil and, because the climbing seemed thin and the protection seemed lacking, a peg was put in. As it turns out, the peg wasn't really necessary but it is still reassuring for the final crux move topping out. If your ethics or conscience do not allow you to clip it, then don’t . Either way, only God (and your second) will know and no one will care. ARTEMIS 80m E2 5a 5b/c Location: 10m to the right (East) of Unseen Things Above, the first pitch climbs the left-slanting groove between the flake/buttress and the wall behind. (Unseen Things climbs the left edge of this buttress). The groove is vegetated but this is of no consequence since the climbing consists of bridging between the edge of the flake and the clean, solid and delightfully knobbly back wall. The top 25m of the second pitch is superb high-quality climbing on clean rock. 1. 35m 5a. Up a couple of metres of vegetation to reach rock and then the groove. Bridge up this to a grassy belay. 2. 45m 5b/c. From the belay, go up and right over easy ground for 20m towards the (very small) corner in the centre of the face. Where the rock steepens, follow the edge of the triangular flake to the base of the corner . This is marked by a small square plate jutting from a slot. Climb confidently to the top, finding good protection from small nuts for most of the way. APOLLO 80m HVS 5a 4c 1. 35m 5a Pitch 1 of Artemis. 2. 45m 4c From the belay, go up and slightly left towards a stunted (pedunculate-) oak tree. Squirm past this on the right and follow a good edge and crack towards a (scary-looking but actually sound) hanging flake. Pass this on the left to the top. UNSEEN THINGS ABOVE 80m E2 5b 5c 5b Location: Jacob’s Ladder is easily identified by the detached block at its base. The bay to the right (East) of it is defined on its right hand side by an obvious overhanging corner/groove. 1. 30m 5b Climb the groove, exiting right into a good belay nest. 2. 25m 5c From the belay, traverse delicately left for two metres to a narrow grass ledge and follow the crack up to the slot above. Intricate climbing through this leads to a grassy platform. 3. 25m 5b. From the belay, go up and, on the left of the arete, pull strenuously up the flake-crack to a stance and then, to avoid thin suspect flakes, keep left and climb spectacularly up the edge of the thin-but-solid sharp arete to its top. From here, protection can be found in the bottom of the crack to the left, which separates the glass-smooth slab from heathery rock. The top is a few metres up. Walk off from here i.e. below the top band of rock. JACOB'S LADDER 82m HS [original grade - but read to the end] This is a good climb in a good situation. The route climbs the stepped-ladder feature, one third of the way down the crag from Mahon Falls, that forms the right-hand boundary of the large wide-vee gully. The left-hand branch of this gully provides a convenient [if somewhat sketchy] descent. The route starts from a detached boulder. 1. 25m. Climb straight up the face of the rib to grassy top. 2. 35m. Up slab and obvious vee-chimney. Continue up smooth slab to grass ledge. ART THOU ELIAS? 60m VS 4c 4c Location: This is the stepped arete opposite Jacob’s Ladder , across the mouth of the forked gully. It is the next gully right (East) from Dreaming Gully. 1. 20m 4c + 10m to the belay. Start just left of the ‘Plank’ and follow the rough crack which snakes up to a little overhang at the top. Go through the centre of this overhang to a lovely little promontory. 2. 30m Severe, except for one 4c move as described: At the overhanging split nose, move up to the right and make an exciting move onto a small flat foothold just above the overhang on the point of the nose, and continue up the groove. Scramble up to the terrace and descend via Dreaming Gully (Forked Gully not recommended without prior knowledge). SUMMER OF ‘69 63m HVS 4c 4c 4b Location: About 60m right from Dreaming Gully - mid-way between it and Forked Gully - is a dark wet blind gully with a jammed square block. The route starts at the right hand side of this gully. 1. 28m 4c Climb the rib, heading for the corner above. A considered, cautious approach to the rock is indicated for the rib. At the band of vegetation, follow the crack on the left and up heather to belay below the corner. 2. 25m 4c Good climbing up the corner, with good gear. Belay at the comfortable ledge. 3.10m 4b Climb up and to the right towards the attractive face of the overhanging prow and up this easily but spectacularly to belay above. Cross the heather isthmus and up the easy-angled slab to the terrace. CAMEL MEETS NEEDLE 80m E2 4c 5c Location: mid-way between Dreaming Gully and Forked Gully is the blind gully/chimney with the jammed blocks mentioned above. Ten or twelve metres left from this, a scruffy arete slants up to converge at the same point at the top. This arete is an obvious feature and draws the eye as you approach the Falls. 1. 50m 4c Start below the arete, which is undercut at the bottom. Surmount the overhang (gear available below it) to gain the arete. Continue for 50m to the bare rock pillar. Some vegetation must be passed on the journey up. Protection is well-spaced but sufficient. 2. 30m 5c Continue easily and securely to the crux slot. This is awkward and committing: movement is limited by the confines of the slot, and the overlying left wall pushes the climber off balance. Once the move is initiated, there is no going back, as, because it is undercut here, the feet are lost. Move right onto the hanging slab, and more-easily up to the cave. Wriggle through the window to emerge on top. Good belay anchors are to be found just across the neck, looking down into Forked Gully. If it turns out that you are too well-fed to fit through the window (it is quite small), all is not lost: the rock to the left of the cave is climbable. Likewise, if defeated by the crux slot, a traverse right from above the belay will take you to the main gully groove, which is fairly-easily climbable at this point (this was checked on abseil). A note on the grade: The character and challenges of each of the two pitches is so completely different, that coming up with an overall grade is difficult. The technical crux is stiff, but short and well-protected; the first pitch is not technically difficult but might disconcert those unused to such terrain. The grade given attempts to take both these considerations into account. N.B For historical reasons, the routes on the cliff are listed from right (SE) to left (NW) - which is why the route above is the closest to Dreaming Gully."

            "description": "This climb is just to the left of the second big grass gully west from the waterfall. The gully is distinguishable by a rock island in its lower part. Start at the foot of a small slabby buttress. 1. 24m. Climb the buttress and scramble up grass to the foot of a wall. Conglomerate - fairly sound. 2. 12m. Climb the wall moving left. , then right to a ledge. Conglomerate - fairly sound. 3. 9m. Climb the wall above the ledge. Go diagonally left. , then move right just below a grass ledge and climb into a recess. Conglomerate - fairly sound. 4. 9m. Pull out of the recess, up rock, and then steep grass to the foot of a chimney in a corner. Conglomerate - fairly sound. The chimney is the logical finish, but it is very loose (sandstone) and the climb was finished as follows - 5. 18m. Traverse left round a corner into a grassy recess and then climb a chimney to easy ground. Sandstone - loose. TOADPIPE DIRECT 71m VS 4b, 4b, 4b, 4c/5a In trying to find the fit between the physical features of this buttress and the written description of Toadpipe , the conclusion is reached that that route follows ‘the line of least resistance’ . At the top, in particular, the only possible match with the loose sandstone chimneys mentioned, is on heather up the scruffy right hand side of the buttress. The Direct route takes an uncompromising line up the centre of the buttress, heading for the large right-facing corner at the top. The climbing is not difficult but the exposure is considerable and protection minimal, including at the belays. 1. 28m 4b A show of intent is given by climbing straight through the overhang halfway up (having placed the first and last protection of the pitch) rather than skirting around it to the left. Continue up heather to the next rock wall. 2. 22m 4b Straight up to a good ledge. 3. 15m 4b To corner. 4. 6m 4c/5a Corner to top. SUPER FLUMINA 82m E1 3c 5a 5b Location: This goes up the centre, to the highest point of the Screwtape/Raving buttress, going straight through some unlikely-looking overhanging territory in its the upper reaches. Start: 20m to the right of the rib of Raving. 1. 30m 3c Scramble up the 45 degree sloping ramp leftwards to a little bay, backed by a clean rock face and a poor belay at its left-hand side. 2. 24m 5a Traverse right atop a thin sheet of soggy vegetation to a wet corner and good anchors. Climb up here, going out from the corner to the arete. Continue up the edge of a large flake, pass behind this, and up another arete to a large grassy ledge. This ledge has been otherwise untroubled by the feet of men or beasts. 3. 28m 5b Climb up from where you arrived at the ledge, being careful not to dislodge the loose blocks near the arete and continue up the grooves above. These grooves are the product of two intersecting sets of vertical joints that here give rise to a series of grooves of about 60 degrees, separated from their neighbours by little aretes of a similar angle, producing, in this part of the cliff only, a columnar appearance to the rock. The first two pitches were climbed on sight. The top 10m of the top pitch was glanced at, but not touched, two years earlier on abseil in a scan of the likely feasibility of the line. RAVING 137m HS Start - To the right of Screwtape 1. Up the obvious rib. 2. Loose rock to a belay in the corner. 3. A steep wall to easier ground. 4. Traverse left and finish up last pitch of Screwtape. (There is a direct finish but it is loose and was not led). SCREWTAPE 79m HS Start - Just right of a deep gully, the third from the waterfall slabs below a big nose. 1. 18m. Up a few feet, then move left onto the nose, up, back R. and straight up to a ledge. (Conglomerate - rotten). 2. 15m. Up the wall on the left, then R. , then L. round the bulge and up easily to the bridge of the nose (Conglomerate - very rotten). 3. 24m. Up grass slopes heading for the L. edge of the big buttress above. Then traverse R. on loose flakes and climb up into the recess, (Sandstone - loose). 4. 21m. Up grass slopes heading for the L. edge of the big buttress above. but for more interest, traverse R. down a grassy ramp, swing round onto a rib, and climb it to the top. (Sandstone). <u>Screwtape Revisited</u> There is evidence, on both sides of the valley for the squeezing of the rocks, at some time, along an axis approximately SE - NW. This is most apparent in the finer-grained layers, resulting in a cleavage at a high angle to the more-or-less horizontal lie of the beds. It can also be seen, though less-well developed in the coarser-grained conglomerate. Screwtape is a good place to observe this! SCREWTAPE REVISITED 80m E1 4c, 4c, Diff, 5b, 5a 1. 18m 4c Good climbing as described. Rock: flaky-looking but, treated with respect, good. 2. 15m 4c As described. Rock quality of initial wall excellent; then a scramble to a little col. 3. 20m Diff. A little bit of easy rock, then grass, then more easy rock and more grass. Rock quality: irrelevant. 4. 20m 5b Go up easily to a little rock wall above a patch of small willows and place some good protection. Then, descend to the right, behind the trees, to the edge of the void. [It might be necessary to pull up one rope and throw it back down, so that it can be clear of the trees.] Edge gingerly across to gain the undercut arete, avoiding some suspect flakes. A couple of moves brings you to a position of remarkable exposure - standing on a small square jutting block, with 60m of fresh air beneath your feet. Go around the arete and make some technical moves to a ledge. Rock quality: excellent. AT THE PITTES BRINKE 65m E1 5a 5b/c 20m to the right of The Line, a moist corner slants across to the left at an angle of 30 degrees to meet an overlap at 10m. 1. 38m 5a Start a couple of metres left of the corner and climb the slab, heading for the junction between corner and overlap. Good protection can be found here for the move through the overlap. On the slab above, follow the left slanting crack until it becomes a small corner and here climb the little arete to grass and gear (30m). Make a rising traverse across grass and woodrush for 8m to a good stance below the square arete. 2. 27m 5b/c climb the arete, mostly on its right hand side to its apex. Then, move boldly right, following a thin curving undercut crack onto the hanging slab. Thin moves but with some good protection, lead up past a fist-sized slot to the top. Abseiled previously to check the availability of protection above the overlap on pitch one and for some cleaning at the overlap. Little or no account was taken of the second pitch. THE LINE 65m E2 5b 5b Location: In the centre of the cliff, mid-way between Jacob’s Ladder and Screwtape. The first pitch climbs the ruler-straight left-facing corner; the second pitch continues up the left side of the light-coloured prow above. 1. 40m 5b. Easy ground, then keep to the slab to the right until you can step left onto the grass pad in the corner. Above, the back wall bulges. Getting up this is the crux and the gear here is small, hard to find and hard to trust but ‘be ye men of valour’ , there are better holds and gear-placements above. Follow the corner to its very end (including the grassy top) to belay immediately below the headwall. 2. 25m 5b Follow the cracks above the belay. Holds and gear placements abound but the wall overhangs slightly making it quite pumpy. The angle eases towards the top. AND I SAW A NEW HEAVEN 68m E1 5a 5b An excellent route with a good variety of climbing. The first pitch may look a little scruffy and ill-defined but the climbing is good and the route makes perfect sense when you are on it. Location: Midway between Jacob’s Ladder and The Line, is a poorly-defined, broken A-shaped buttress, just to the right of the start of Artemis and Apollo; at its base is a clean 8m slab at a comfortable angle. 1. 38m 5a Climb the slab (unprotected) then move left to rough rock. Go up the arete and then the left-slanting corner, then up a steep crack. This leads to a near-vertical grass sheet. Before this is reached, a broken crack joins from the right. Follow this at an easier angle, over vegetation and go up past a square jammed flake of unknown security to belay in a corner beside a patch of furze. 2. 30m 5b From the belay, move out boldly right onto the clean jutting nose. Climb to the top of this (good nuts in a crack) and move to the right into a rectangular recess resembling a door-case, complete with a square-cut lintel making a little roof at the top. Exit left into the generous cleaned groove and continue up into the clean corner above. Go up past the peg to the top of the corner and top out to the right The route was first attempted on 29/4. The first pitch received extensive cleaning with an ice-axe on lead. The second pitch was not amenable to on-sight cleaning and, in its uncleaned state did not seem ‘justifiable’ , and a different (though not easier or safer) line was taken to the left. This was written up at the time as Sicut Cervus E2 5a 5b but can safely be relegated to the position of footnote. The corner and (especially) the groove were cleaned a week later on abseil and, because the climbing seemed thin and the protection seemed lacking, a peg was put in. As it turns out, the peg wasn't really necessary but it is still reassuring for the final crux move topping out. If your ethics or conscience do not allow you to clip it, then don’t .

AT THE PITTES BRINKE 65m E1 5a 5b/c 20m to the right of The Line, a moist corner slants across to the left at an angle of 30 degrees to meet an overlap at 10m. 1. 38m 5a Start a couple of metres left of the corner and climb the slab, heading for the junction between corner and overlap. Good protection can be found here for the move through the overlap. On the slab above, follow the left slanting crack until it becomes a small corner and here climb the little arete to grass and gear (30m). Make a rising traverse across grass and woodrush for 8m to a good stance below the square arete. 2. 27m 5b/c climb the arete, mostly on its right hand side to its apex. Then, move boldly right, following a thin curving undercut crack onto the hanging slab. Thin moves but with some good protection, lead up past a fist-sized slot to the top. Abseiled previously to check the availability of protection above the overlap on pitch one and for some cleaning at the overlap. Little or no account was taken of the second pitch. THE LINE 65m E2 5b 5b Location: In the centre of the cliff, mid-way between Jacob’s Ladder and Screwtape. The first pitch climbs the ruler-straight left-facing corner; the second pitch continues up the left side of the light-coloured prow above. 1. 40m 5b. Easy ground, then keep to the slab to the right until you can step left onto the grass pad in the corner. Above, the back wall bulges. Getting up this is the crux and the gear here is small, hard to find and hard to trust but ‘be ye men of valour’ , there are better holds and gear-placements above. Follow the corner to its very end (including the grassy top) to belay immediately below the headwall. 2. 25m 5b Follow the cracks above the belay. Holds and gear placements abound but the wall overhangs slightly making it quite pumpy. The angle eases towards the top. AND I SAW A NEW HEAVEN 68m E1 5a 5b An excellent route with a good variety of climbing. The first pitch may look a little scruffy and ill-defined but the climbing is good and the route makes perfect sense when you are on it. Location: Midway between Jacob’s Ladder and The Line, is a poorly-defined, broken A-shaped buttress, just to the right of the start of Artemis and Apollo; at its base is a clean 8m slab at a comfortable angle. 1. 38m 5a Climb the slab (unprotected) then move left to rough rock. Go up the arete and then the left-slanting corner, then up a steep crack. This leads to a near-vertical grass sheet. Before this is reached, a broken crack joins from the right. Follow this at an easier angle, over vegetation and go up past a square jammed flake of unknown security to belay in a corner beside a patch of furze. 2. 30m 5b From the belay, move out boldly right onto the clean jutting nose. Climb to the top of this (good nuts in a crack) and move to the right into a rectangular recess resembling a door-case, complete with a square-cut lintel making a little roof at the top. Exit left into the generous cleaned groove and continue up into the clean corner above. Go up past the peg to the top of the corner and top out to the right The route was first attempted on 29/4. The first pitch received extensive cleaning with an ice-axe on lead. The second pitch was not amenable to on-sight cleaning and, in its uncleaned state did not seem ‘justifiable’ , and a different (though not easier or safer) line was taken to the left. This was written up at the time as Sicut Cervus E2 5a 5b but can safely be relegated to the position of footnote. The corner and (especially) the groove were cleaned a week later on abseil and, because the climbing seemed thin and the protection seemed lacking, a peg was put in. As it turns out, the peg wasn't really necessary but it is still reassuring for the final crux move topping out. If your ethics or conscience do not allow you to clip it, then don’t . Either way, only God (and your second) will know and no one will care. ARTEMIS 80m E2 5a 5b/c Location: 10m to the right (East) of Unseen Things Above, the first pitch climbs the left-slanting groove between the flake/buttress and the wall behind. (Unseen Things climbs the left edge of this buttress). The groove is vegetated but this is of no consequence since the climbing consists of bridging between the edge of the flake and the clean, solid and delightfully knobbly back wall. The top 25m of the second pitch is superb high-quality climbing on clean rock. 1. 35m 5a. Up a couple of metres of vegetation to reach rock and then the groove. Bridge up this to a grassy belay. 2. 45m 5b/c. From the belay, go up and right over easy ground for 20m towards the (very small) corner in the centre of the face. Where the rock steepens, follow the edge of the triangular flake to the base of the corner . This is marked by a small square plate jutting from a slot. Climb confidently to the top, finding good protection from small nuts for most of the way. APOLLO 80m HVS 5a 4c 1. 35m 5a Pitch 1 of Artemis. 2. 45m 4c From the belay, go up and slightly left towards a stunted (pedunculate-) oak tree. Squirm past this on the right and follow a good edge and crack towards a (scary-looking but actually sound) hanging flake. Pass this on the left to the top. UNSEEN THINGS ABOVE 80m E2 5b 5c 5b Location: Jacob’s Ladder is easily identified by the detached block at its base. The bay to the right (East) of it is defined on its right hand side by an obvious overhanging corner/groove. 1. 30m 5b Climb the groove, exiting right into a good belay nest. 2. 25m 5c From the belay, traverse delicately left for two metres to a narrow grass ledge and follow the crack up to the slot above. Intricate climbing through this leads to a grassy platform. 3. 25m 5b. From the belay, go up and, on the left of the arete, pull strenuously up the flake-crack to a stance and then, to avoid thin suspect flakes, keep left and climb spectacularly up the edge of the thin-but-solid sharp arete to its top. From here, protection can be found in the bottom of the crack to the left, which separates the glass-smooth slab from heathery rock. The top is a few metres up. Walk off from here i.e. below the top band of rock. JACOB'S LADDER 82m HS [original grade - but read to the end] This is a good climb in a good situation. The route climbs the stepped-ladder feature, one third of the way down the crag from Mahon Falls, that forms the right-hand boundary of the large wide-vee gully. The left-hand branch of this gully provides a convenient [if somewhat sketchy] descent. The route starts from a detached boulder. 1. 25m. Climb straight up the face of the rib to grassy top. 2. 35m. Up slab and obvious vee-chimney. Continue up smooth slab to grass ledge. ART THOU ELIAS? 60m VS 4c 4c Location: This is the stepped arete opposite Jacob’s Ladder , across the mouth of the forked gully. It is the next gully right (East) from Dreaming Gully. 1. 20m 4c + 10m to the belay. Start just left of the ‘Plank’ and follow the rough crack which snakes up to a little overhang at the top. Go through the centre of this overhang to a lovely little promontory. 2. 30m Severe, except for one 4c move as described: At the overhanging split nose, move up to the right and make an exciting move onto a small flat foothold just above the overhang on the point of the nose, and continue up the groove. Scramble up to the terrace and descend via Dreaming Gully (Forked Gully not recommended without prior knowledge). SUMMER OF ‘69 63m HVS 4c 4c 4b Location: About 60m right from Dreaming Gully - mid-way between it and Forked Gully - is a dark wet blind gully with a jammed square block. The route starts at the right hand side of this gully. 1. 28m 4c Climb the rib, heading for the corner above. A considered, cautious approach to the rock is indicated for the rib. At the band of vegetation, follow the crack on the left and up heather to belay below the corner. 2. 25m 4c Good climbing up the corner, with good gear. Belay at the comfortable ledge. 3.10m 4b Climb up and to the right towards the attractive face of the overhanging prow and up this easily but spectacularly to belay above. Cross the heather isthmus and up the easy-angled slab to the terrace. CAMEL MEETS NEEDLE 80m E2 4c 5c Location: mid-way between Dreaming Gully and Forked Gully is the blind gully/chimney with the jammed blocks mentioned above. Ten or twelve metres left from this, a scruffy arete slants up to converge at the same point at the top. This arete is an obvious feature and draws the eye as you approach the Falls. 1. 50m 4c Start below the arete, which is undercut at the bottom. Surmount the overhang (gear available below it) to gain the arete. Continue for 50m to the bare rock pillar. Some vegetation must be passed on the journey up. Protection is well-spaced but sufficient. 2. 30m 5c Continue easily and securely to the crux slot. This is awkward and committing: movement is limited by the confines of the slot, and the overlying left wall pushes the climber off balance. Once the move is initiated, there is no going back, as, because it is undercut here, the feet are lost. Move right onto the hanging slab, and more-easily up to the cave. Wriggle through the window to emerge on top. Good belay anchors are to be found just across the neck, looking down into Forked Gully. If it turns out that you are too well-fed to fit through the window (it is quite small), all is not lost: the rock to the left of the cave is climbable. Likewise, if defeated by the crux slot, a traverse right from above the belay will take you to the main gully groove, which is fairly-easily climbable at this point (this was checked on abseil). A note on the grade: The character and challenges of each of the two pitches is so completely different, that coming up with an overall grade is difficult. The technical crux is stiff, but short and well-protected; the first pitch is not technically difficult but might disconcert those unused to such terrain. The grade given attempts to take both these considerations into account. N.B For historical reasons, the routes on the cliff are listed from right (SE) to left (NW) - which is why the route above is the closest to Dreaming Gully."

Start: 20m to the right of the rib of Raving. 1. 30m 3c Scramble up the 45 degree sloping ramp leftwards to a little bay, backed by a clean rock face and a poor belay at its left-hand side. 2. 24m 5a Traverse right atop a thin sheet of soggy vegetation to a wet corner and good anchors. Climb up here, going out from the corner to the arete. Continue up the edge of a large flake, pass behind this, and up another arete to a large grassy ledge. This ledge has been otherwise untroubled by the feet of men or beasts. 3. 28m 5b Climb up from where you arrived at the ledge, being careful not to dislodge the loose blocks near the arete and continue up the grooves above. These grooves are the product of two intersecting sets of vertical joints that here give rise to a series of grooves of about 60 degrees, separated from their neighbours by little aretes of a similar angle, producing, in this part of the cliff only, a columnar appearance to the rock. The first two pitches were climbed on sight. The top 10m of the top pitch was glanced at, but not touched, two years earlier on abseil in a scan of the likely feasibility of the line. RAVING 137m HS Start - To the right of Screwtape 1. Up the obvious rib. 2. Loose rock to a belay in the corner. 3. A steep wall to easier ground. 4.

(Sandstone). <u>Screwtape Revisited</u> There is evidence, on both sides of the valley for the squeezing of the rocks, at some time, along an axis approximately SE - NW. This is most apparent in the finer-grained layers, resulting in a cleavage at a high angle to the more-or-less horizontal lie of the beds. It can also be seen, though less-well developed in the coarser-grained conglomerate. Screwtape is a good place to observe this! SCREWTAPE REVISITED 80m E1 4c, 4c, Diff, 5b, 5a 1. 18m 4c Good climbing as described. Rock: flaky-looking but, treated with respect, good. 2. 15m 4c As described. Rock quality of initial wall excellent; then a scramble to a little col. 3. 20m Diff. A little bit of easy rock, then grass, then more easy rock and more grass. Rock quality: irrelevant. 4. 20m 5b Go up easily to a little rock wall above a patch of small willows and place some good protection. Then, descend to the right, behind the trees, to the edge of the void.

Location: Midway between Jacob’s Ladder and The Line, is a poorly-defined, broken A-shaped buttress, just to the right of the start of Artemis and Apollo; at its base is a clean 8m slab at a comfortable angle. 1. 38m 5a Climb the slab (unprotected) then move left to rough rock. Go up the arete and then the left-slanting corner, then up a steep crack. This leads to a near-vertical grass sheet. Before this is reached, a broken crack joins from the right. Follow this at an easier angle, over vegetation and go up past a square jammed flake of unknown security to belay in a corner beside a patch of furze. 2. 30m 5b From the belay, move out boldly right onto the clean jutting nose. Climb to the top of this (good nuts in a crack) and move to the right into a rectangular recess resembling a door-case, complete with a square-cut lintel making a little roof at the top. Exit left into the generous cleaned groove and continue up into the clean corner above. Go up past the peg to the top of the corner and top out to the right The route was first attempted on 29/4. The first pitch received extensive cleaning with an ice-axe on lead. The second pitch was not amenable to on-sight cleaning and, in its uncleaned state did not seem ‘justifiable’ , and a different (though not easier or safer) line was taken to the left. This was written up at the time as Sicut Cervus E2 5a 5b but can safely be relegated to the position of footnote. The corner and (especially) the groove were cleaned a week later on abseil and, because the climbing seemed thin and the protection seemed lacking, a peg was put in. As it turns out, the peg wasn't really necessary but it is still reassuring for the final crux move topping out. If your ethics or conscience do not allow you to clip it, then don’t . Either way, only God (and your second) will know and no one will care. ARTEMIS 80m E2 5a 5b/c Location: 10m to the right (East) of Unseen Things Above, the first pitch climbs the left-slanting groove between the flake/buttress and the wall behind. (Unseen Things climbs the left edge of this buttress). The groove is vegetated but this is of no consequence since the climbing consists of bridging between the edge of the flake and the clean, solid and delightfully knobbly back wall. The top 25m of the second pitch is superb high-quality climbing on clean rock. 1. 35m 5a. Up a couple of metres of vegetation to reach rock and then the groove. Bridge up this to a grassy belay. 2. 45m 5b/c. From the belay, go up and right over easy ground for 20m towards the (very small) corner in the centre of the face. Where the rock steepens, follow the edge of the triangular flake to the base of the corner . This is marked by a small square plate jutting from a slot. Climb confidently to the top, finding good protection from small nuts for most of the way. APOLLO 80m HVS 5a 4c 1. 35m 5a Pitch 1 of Artemis. 2. 45m 4c From the belay, go up and slightly left towards a stunted (pedunculate-) oak tree. Squirm past this on the right and follow a good edge and crack towards a (scary-looking but actually sound) hanging flake. Pass this on the left to the top. UNSEEN THINGS ABOVE 80m E2 5b 5c 5b Location: Jacob’s Ladder is easily identified by the detached block at its base. The bay to the right (East) of it is defined on its right hand side by an obvious overhanging corner/groove. 1. 30m 5b Climb the groove, exiting right into a good belay nest. 2. 25m 5c From the belay, traverse delicately left for two metres to a narrow grass ledge and follow the crack up to the slot above. Intricate climbing through this leads to a grassy platform. 3. 25m 5b. From the belay, go up and, on the left of the arete, pull strenuously up the flake-crack to a stance and then, to avoid thin suspect flakes, keep left and climb spectacularly up the edge of the thin-but-solid sharp arete to its top. From here, protection can be found in the bottom of the crack to the left, which separates the glass-smooth slab from heathery rock. The top is a few metres up. Walk off from here i.e. below the top band of rock. JACOB'S LADDER 82m HS [original grade - but read to the end] This is a good climb in a good situation. The route climbs the stepped-ladder feature, one third of the way down the crag from Mahon Falls, that forms the right-hand boundary of the large wide-vee gully. The left-hand branch of this gully provides a convenient [if somewhat sketchy] descent. The route starts from a detached boulder. 1. 25m. Climb straight up the face of the rib to grassy top. 2. 35m. Up slab and obvious vee-chimney. Continue up smooth slab to grass ledge. ART THOU ELIAS? 60m VS 4c 4c Location: This is the stepped arete opposite Jacob’s Ladder , across the mouth of the forked gully. It is the next gully right (East) from Dreaming Gully. 1. 20m 4c + 10m to the belay. Start just left of the ‘Plank’ and follow the rough crack which snakes up to a little overhang at the top. Go through the centre of this overhang to a lovely little promontory. 2. 30m Severe, except for one 4c move as described: At the overhanging split nose, move up to the right and make an exciting move onto a small flat foothold just above the overhang on the point of the nose, and continue up the groove. Scramble up to the terrace and descend via Dreaming Gully (Forked Gully not recommended without prior knowledge). SUMMER OF ‘69 63m HVS 4c 4c 4b Location: About 60m right from Dreaming Gully - mid-way between it and Forked Gully - is a dark wet blind gully with a jammed square block. The route starts at the right hand side of this gully. 1. 28m 4c Climb the rib, heading for the corner above. A considered, cautious approach to the rock is indicated for the rib. At the band of vegetation, follow the crack on the left and up heather to belay below the corner. 2. 25m 4c Good climbing up the corner, with good gear. Belay at the comfortable ledge. 3.10m 4b Climb up and to the right towards the attractive face of the overhanging prow and up this easily but spectacularly to belay above. Cross the heather isthmus and up the easy-angled slab to the terrace. CAMEL MEETS NEEDLE 80m E2 4c 5c Location: mid-way between Dreaming Gully and Forked Gully is the blind gully/chimney with the jammed blocks mentioned above. Ten or twelve metres left from this, a scruffy arete slants up to converge at the same point at the top. This arete is an obvious feature and draws the eye as you approach the Falls. 1. 50m 4c Start below the arete, which is undercut at the bottom. Surmount the overhang (gear available below it) to gain the arete. Continue for 50m to the bare rock pillar. Some vegetation must be passed on the journey up. Protection is well-spaced but sufficient. 2. 30m 5c Continue easily and securely to the crux slot. This is awkward and committing: movement is limited by the confines of the slot, and the overlying left wall pushes the climber off balance. Once the move is initiated, there is no going back, as, because it is undercut here, the feet are lost. Move right onto the hanging slab, and more-easily up to the cave. Wriggle through the window to emerge on top. Good belay anchors are to be found just across the neck, looking down into Forked Gully. If it turns out that you are too well-fed to fit through the window (it is quite small), all is not lost: the rock to the left of the cave is climbable. Likewise, if defeated by the crux slot, a traverse right from above the belay will take you to the main gully groove, which is fairly-easily climbable at this point (this was checked on abseil). A note on the grade: The character and challenges of each of the two pitches is so completely different, that coming up with an overall grade is difficult. The technical crux is stiff, but short and well-protected; the first pitch is not technically difficult but might disconcert those unused to such terrain. The grade given attempts to take both these considerations into account. N.B For historical reasons, the routes on the cliff are listed from right (SE) to left (NW) - which is why the route above is the closest to Dreaming Gully."

(Sandstone). <u>Screwtape Revisited</u> There is evidence, on both sides of the valley for the squeezing of the rocks, at some time, along an axis approximately SE - NW. This is most apparent in the finer-grained layers, resulting in a cleavage at a high angle to the more-or-less horizontal lie of the beds. It can also be seen, though less-well developed in the coarser-grained conglomerate. Screwtape is a good place to observe this! SCREWTAPE REVISITED 80m E1 4c, 4c, Diff, 5b, 5a 1. 18m 4c Good climbing as described. Rock: flaky-looking but, treated with respect, good. 2. 15m 4c As described. Rock quality of initial wall excellent; then a scramble to a little col. 3. 20m Diff. A little bit of easy rock, then grass, then more easy rock and more grass. Rock quality: irrelevant. 4. 20m 5b Go up easily to a little rock wall above a patch of small willows and place some good protection. Then, descend to the right, behind the trees, to the edge of the void. [It might be necessary to pull up one rope and throw it back down, so that it can be clear of the trees.] Edge gingerly across to gain the undercut arete, avoiding some suspect flakes. A couple of moves brings you to a position of remarkable exposure - standing on a small square jutting block, with 60m of fresh air beneath your feet. Go around the arete and make some technical moves to a ledge. Rock quality: excellent. AT THE PITTES BRINKE 65m E1 5a 5b/c 20m to the right of The Line, a moist corner slants across to the left at an angle of 30 degrees to meet an overlap at 10m. 1. 38m 5a Start a couple of metres left of the corner and climb the slab, heading for the junction between corner and overlap. Good protection can be found here for the move through the overlap. On the slab above, follow the left slanting crack until it becomes a small corner and here climb the little arete to grass and gear (30m). Make a rising traverse across grass and woodrush for 8m to a good stance below the square arete. 2. 27m 5b/c climb the arete, mostly on its right hand side to its apex. Then, move boldly right, following a thin curving undercut crack onto the hanging slab. Thin moves but with some good protection, lead up past a fist-sized slot to the top. Abseiled previously to check the availability of protection above the overlap on pitch one and for some cleaning at the overlap. Little or no account was taken of the second pitch. THE LINE 65m E2 5b 5b Location: In the centre of the cliff, mid-way between Jacob’s Ladder and Screwtape. The first pitch climbs the ruler-straight left-facing corner; the second pitch continues up the left side of the light-coloured prow above. 1. 40m 5b. Easy ground, then keep to the slab to the right until you can step left onto the grass pad in the corner. Above, the back wall bulges. Getting up this is the crux and the gear here is small, hard to find and hard to trust but ‘be ye men of valour’ , there are better holds and gear-placements above. Follow the corner to its very end (including the grassy top) to belay immediately below the headwall. 2. 25m 5b Follow the cracks above the belay. Holds and gear placements abound but the wall overhangs slightly making it quite pumpy. The angle eases towards the top.

Go through the centre of this overhang to a lovely little promontory. 2. 30m Severe, except for one 4c move as described: At the overhanging split nose, move up to the right and make an exciting move onto a small flat foothold just above the overhang on the point of the nose, and continue up the groove. Scramble up to the terrace and descend via Dreaming Gully (Forked Gully not recommended without prior knowledge). SUMMER OF ‘69 63m HVS 4c 4c 4b Location: About 60m right from Dreaming Gully - mid-way between it and Forked Gully - is a dark wet blind gully with a jammed square block. The route starts at the right hand side of this gully. 1. 28m 4c Climb the rib, heading for the corner above. A considered, cautious approach to the rock is indicated for the rib. At the band of vegetation, follow the crack on the left and up heather to belay below the corner. 2. 25m 4c Good climbing up the corner, with good gear. Belay at the comfortable ledge. 3.10m 4b Climb up and to the right towards the attractive face of the overhanging prow and up this easily but spectacularly to belay above. Cross the heather isthmus and up the easy-angled slab to the terrace. CAMEL MEETS NEEDLE 80m E2 4c 5c Location: mid-way between Dreaming Gully and Forked Gully is the blind gully/chimney with the jammed blocks mentioned above. Ten or twelve metres left from this, a scruffy arete slants up to converge at the same point at the top. This arete is an obvious feature and draws the eye as you approach the Falls. 1. 50m 4c Start below the arete, which is undercut at the bottom. Surmount the overhang (gear available below it) to gain the arete. Continue for 50m to the bare rock pillar. Some vegetation must be passed on the journey up. Protection is well-spaced but sufficient. 2. 30m 5c Continue easily and securely to the crux slot. This is awkward and committing: movement is limited by the confines of the slot, and the overlying left wall pushes the climber off balance. Once the move is initiated, there is no going back, as, because it is undercut here, the feet are lost. Move right onto the hanging slab, and more-easily up to the cave. Wriggle through the window to emerge on top. Good belay anchors are to be found just across the neck, looking down into Forked Gully. If it turns out that you are too well-fed to fit through the window (it is quite small), all is not lost: the rock to the left of the cave is climbable. Likewise, if defeated by the crux slot, a traverse right from above the belay will take you to the main gully groove, which is fairly-easily climbable at this point (this was checked on abseil). A note on the grade: The character and challenges of each of the two pitches is so completely different, that coming up with an overall grade is difficult. The technical crux is stiff, but short and well-protected; the first pitch is not technically difficult but might disconcert those unused to such terrain. The grade given attempts to take both these considerations into account. N.B For historical reasons, the routes on the cliff are listed from right (SE) to left (NW) - which is why the route above is the closest to Dreaming Gully."

Good protection can be found here for the move through the overlap. On the slab above, follow the left slanting crack until it becomes a small corner and here climb the little arete to grass and gear (30m). Make a rising traverse across grass and woodrush for 8m to a good stance below the square arete. 2. 27m 5b/c climb the arete, mostly on its right hand side to its apex. Then, move boldly right, following a thin curving undercut crack onto the hanging slab. Thin moves but with some good protection, lead up past a fist-sized slot to the top. Abseiled previously to check the availability of protection above the overlap on pitch one and for some cleaning at the overlap. Little or no account was taken of the second pitch. THE LINE 65m E2 5b 5b Location: In the centre of the cliff, mid-way between Jacob’s Ladder and Screwtape. The first pitch climbs the ruler-straight left-facing corner; the second pitch continues up the left side of the light-coloured prow above. 1. 40m 5b. Easy ground, then keep to the slab to the right until you can step left onto the grass pad in the corner. Above, the back wall bulges. Getting up this is the crux and the gear here is small, hard to find and hard to trust but ‘be ye men of valour’ , there are better holds and gear-placements above. Follow the corner to its very end (including the grassy top) to belay immediately below the headwall. 2. 25m 5b Follow the cracks above the belay. Holds and gear placements abound but the wall overhangs slightly making it quite pumpy. The angle eases towards the top. AND I SAW A NEW HEAVEN 68m E1 5a 5b An excellent route with a good variety of climbing. The first pitch may look a little scruffy and ill-defined but the climbing is good and the route makes perfect sense when you are on it. Location: Midway between Jacob’s Ladder and The Line, is a poorly-defined, broken A-shaped buttress, just to the right of the start of Artemis and Apollo; at its base is a clean 8m slab at a comfortable angle. 1. 38m 5a Climb the slab (unprotected) then move left to rough rock. Go up the arete and then the left-slanting corner, then up a steep crack. This leads to a near-vertical grass sheet. Before this is reached, a broken crack joins from the right. Follow this at an easier angle, over vegetation and go up past a square jammed flake of unknown security to belay in a corner beside a patch of furze. 2. 30m 5b From the belay, move out boldly right onto the clean jutting nose. Climb to the top of this (good nuts in a crack) and move to the right into a rectangular recess resembling a door-case, complete with a square-cut lintel making a little roof at the top. Exit left into the generous cleaned groove and continue up into the clean corner above. Go up past the peg to the top of the corner and top out to the right The route was first attempted on 29/4. The first pitch received extensive cleaning with an ice-axe on lead. The second pitch was not amenable to on-sight cleaning and, in its uncleaned state did not seem ‘justifiable’ , and a different (though not easier or safer) line was taken to the left. This was written up at the time as Sicut Cervus E2 5a 5b but can safely be relegated to the position of footnote. The corner and (especially) the groove were cleaned a week later on abseil and, because the climbing seemed thin and the protection seemed lacking, a peg was put in. As it turns out, the peg wasn't really necessary but it is still reassuring for the final crux move topping out. If your ethics or conscience do not allow you to clip it, then don’t . Either way, only God (and your second) will know and no one will care. ARTEMIS 80m E2 5a 5b/c Location: 10m to the right (East) of Unseen Things Above, the first pitch climbs the left-slanting groove between the flake/buttress and the wall behind. (Unseen Things climbs the left edge of this buttress). The groove is vegetated but this is of no consequence since the climbing consists of bridging between the edge of the flake and the clean, solid and delightfully knobbly back wall. The top 25m of the second pitch is superb high-quality climbing on clean rock. 1. 35m 5a. Up a couple of metres of vegetation to reach rock and then the groove. Bridge up this to a grassy belay. 2. 45m 5b/c. From the belay, go up and right over easy ground for 20m towards the (very small) corner in the centre of the face. Where the rock steepens, follow the edge of the triangular flake to the base of the corner . This is marked by a small square plate jutting from a slot. Climb confidently to the top, finding good protection from small nuts for most of the way. APOLLO 80m HVS 5a 4c 1. 35m 5a Pitch 1 of Artemis. 2. 45m 4c From the belay, go up and slightly left towards a stunted (pedunculate-) oak tree. Squirm past this on the right and follow a good edge and crack towards a (scary-looking but actually sound) hanging flake. Pass this on the left to the top. UNSEEN THINGS ABOVE 80m E2 5b 5c 5b Location: Jacob’s Ladder is easily identified by the detached block at its base. The bay to the right (East) of it is defined on its right hand side by an obvious overhanging corner/groove. 1. 30m 5b Climb the groove, exiting right into a good belay nest. 2. 25m 5c From the belay, traverse delicately left for two metres to a narrow grass ledge and follow the crack up to the slot above. Intricate climbing through this leads to a grassy platform. 3. 25m 5b. From the belay, go up and, on the left of the arete, pull strenuously up the flake-crack to a stance and then, to avoid thin suspect flakes, keep left and climb spectacularly up the edge of the thin-but-solid sharp arete to its top. From here, protection can be found in the bottom of the crack to the left, which separates the glass-smooth slab from heathery rock. The top is a few metres up. Walk off from here i.e. below the top band of rock. JACOB'S LADDER 82m HS [original grade - but read to the end] This is a good climb in a good situation. The route climbs the stepped-ladder feature, one third of the way down the crag from Mahon Falls, that forms the right-hand boundary of the large wide-vee gully.

Scramble up to the terrace and descend via Dreaming Gully (Forked Gully not recommended without prior knowledge). SUMMER OF ‘69 63m HVS 4c 4c 4b Location: About 60m right from Dreaming Gully - mid-way between it and Forked Gully - is a dark wet blind gully with a jammed square block. The route starts at the right hand side of this gully. 1. 28m 4c Climb the rib, heading for the corner above. A considered, cautious approach to the rock is indicated for the rib. At the band of vegetation, follow the crack on the left and up heather to belay below the corner. 2. 25m 4c Good climbing up the corner, with good gear. Belay at the comfortable ledge. 3.10m 4b Climb up and to the right towards the attractive face of the overhanging prow and up this easily but spectacularly to belay above. Cross the heather isthmus and up the easy-angled slab to the terrace. CAMEL MEETS NEEDLE 80m E2 4c 5c Location: mid-way between Dreaming Gully and Forked Gully is the blind gully/chimney with the jammed blocks mentioned above. Ten or twelve metres left from this, a scruffy arete slants up to converge at the same point at the top. This arete is an obvious feature and draws the eye as you approach the Falls. 1. 50m 4c Start below the arete, which is undercut at the bottom. Surmount the overhang (gear available below it) to gain the arete. Continue for 50m to the bare rock pillar. Some vegetation must be passed on the journey up. Protection is well-spaced but sufficient. 2. 30m 5c Continue easily and securely to the crux slot. This is awkward and committing: movement is limited by the confines of the slot, and the overlying left wall pushes the climber off balance. Once the move is initiated, there is no going back, as, because it is undercut here, the feet are lost. Move right onto the hanging slab, and more-easily up to the cave. Wriggle through the window to emerge on top. Good belay anchors are to be found just across the neck, looking down into Forked Gully. If it turns out that you are too well-fed to fit through the window (it is quite small), all is not lost: the rock to the left of the cave is climbable. Likewise, if defeated by the crux slot, a traverse right from above the belay will take you to the main gully groove, which is fairly-easily climbable at this point (this was checked on abseil). A note on the grade: The character and challenges of each of the two pitches is so completely different, that coming up with an overall grade is difficult. The technical crux is stiff, but short and well-protected; the first pitch is not technically difficult but might disconcert those unused to such terrain. The grade given attempts to take both these considerations into account.

SUMMER OF ‘69 63m HVS 4c 4c 4b Location: About 60m right from Dreaming Gully - mid-way between it and Forked Gully - is a dark wet blind gully with a jammed square block. The route starts at the right hand side of this gully. 1. 28m 4c Climb the rib, heading for the corner above. A considered, cautious approach to the rock is indicated for the rib. At the band of vegetation, follow the crack on the left and up heather to belay below the corner. 2. 25m 4c Good climbing up the corner, with good gear. Belay at the comfortable ledge. 3.10m 4b Climb up and to the right towards the attractive face of the overhanging prow and up this easily but spectacularly to belay above. Cross the heather isthmus and up the easy-angled slab to the terrace. CAMEL MEETS NEEDLE 80m E2 4c 5c Location: mid-way between Dreaming Gully and Forked Gully is the blind gully/chimney with the jammed blocks mentioned above. Ten or twelve metres left from this, a scruffy arete slants up to converge at the same point at the top. This arete is an obvious feature and draws the eye as you approach the Falls. 1. 50m 4c Start below the arete, which is undercut at the bottom. Surmount the overhang (gear available below it) to gain the arete. Continue for 50m to the bare rock pillar. Some vegetation must be passed on the journey up. Protection is well-spaced but sufficient. 2. 30m 5c Continue easily and securely to the crux slot. This is awkward and committing: movement is limited by the confines of the slot, and the overlying left wall pushes the climber off balance. Once the move is initiated, there is no going back, as, because it is undercut here, the feet are lost. Move right onto the hanging slab, and more-easily up to the cave. Wriggle through the window to emerge on top. Good belay anchors are to be found just across the neck, looking down into Forked Gully. If it turns out that you are too well-fed to fit through the window (it is quite small), all is not lost: the rock to the left of the cave is climbable. Likewise, if defeated by the crux slot, a traverse right from above the belay will take you to the main gully groove, which is fairly-easily climbable at this point (this was checked on abseil). A note on the grade: The character and challenges of each of the two pitches is so completely different, that coming up with an overall grade is difficult. The technical crux is stiff, but short and well-protected; the first pitch is not technically difficult but might disconcert those unused to such terrain. The grade given attempts to take both these considerations into account. N.B For historical reasons, the routes on the cliff are listed from right (SE) to left (NW) - which is why the route above is the closest to Dreaming Gully."

The buttress is characterised by its central crack systems and steep walls. The lower section is slightly vegetated, but the upper rock gives enjoyable climbing Sunday’s Joy – Severe, 18m A very pleasant climb up the centre of the buttress. Start below the obvious crack line in the middle of the face. Climb the crack directly, using plentiful holds and good gear placements (cams are especially useful). The climbing is steady with a crux in the middle. It is enjoyable throughout, finishing on easier ground above. A fine outing at the grade, offering a satisfying mix of movement and security. <u>An Giorra Butress</u> This little buttress with the following 2 routes is approximately 100m from the track (to the left) which leads to the Mahon Falls and is approx. 30m above it. It stands out as an obvious vertical and clean piece of rock, about 250m from the car-park, and its south-facing wall is marked on the right hand side by an obvious off-width crack. The first two climbs are at the south-facing wall (facing the car park): CALLUNA 10m HS 4b This route takes the vertical crack line which starts about 3m to the left of An Giorra Maol. Climb the crack for 4m to the rightward trending break, move to the right and continue steeply upwards on bigger and better holds. Belay well back. AN GIORRA MAOL 8m VS 4c This route takes the crackline about one meter to the left of the off-width crack. Well protected. PHLOGISTON 8m E2 6a The ‘obvious off-width’. The crack is deeply undercut at the bottom which makes getting established both difficult and strenuous. For protection, you will need two large cams: a largish one to cover the first move and a second bigger one (Camalot 5 or equivalent) higher up. Further 100 m into the valley, the next three climbs are at an east-facing wall (facing the footpath): LEFT HAND CRACK 8m HVS 5a Climb the left hand crack using some painful hand-jams. CENTRE CRACK 10m HVS 5a This route climbs the obvious jamming crack in the centre of the buttress. RIGHT HAND CRACK 8m HVS 5a The route climbs the thin crack on the right hand side of the wall to gain the terrace above. ==Keating’s Cliff (East-facing cliff)== The following routes are located on the left of the valley as you approach the Mahon Falls. Ancient Rain is in the middle of the high cliff above the path, just above an overhanging rock that juts out from the sloping hillside below. The crag shown in the topo is at the further continuation of this band of cliffs, near to the Falls. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ANCIENT RAIN 65m E2 4c, 5c This route is located on the large and steep crag high up on the left of the valley as you approach the Mahon Falls. It tackles the highest part of the cliff where a double stepped overhang dominates the wall. 1. 20m Start to the left of the overhang, at the base of a corner formed by a slanting and protruding slab/ramp which runs diagonally to the right. Climb up this corner and then the ensuing slab to the large recess below the overhangs. 2. 45m. Bridge up the corner on the left hand side of the overhang until you can commit yourself to the crux sequence on the steep left-hand wall. Keep going on past the overhangs to the niche above and into a groove on the left which eases off to a belay just below the top. Very good protection. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- image:coum mahon.jpg"
