            "description": "The following routes are reached from Mixed Up by scrambling around the corner and down to a large flat platform. Buzzback S This route starts left around the corner from Rainshelter. It is the last obvious line before the zawn. It follows an obvious crack for a few metres. and then continues more easily up the arete. Rainshelter VD The large corner on the left of the platform. Fairy Village HS 4b This route follows the twin cracks in the middle of the wall just right of the large corner of Rainshelter. Scales VS 4b The twin cracks on the right hand side of the platform. The moves are not difficult and the line is obvious but the rock is not as reassuring as on other routes, hence the VS grade. Rocking at the Lighthouse 22m S Start on the platform right and above of Scales, climb the leftwards trending cracks over shelves to a ledge. Climb the 3m wall to a second ledge and finish up a leftwards facing corner. Moss flavored 22m S There is a high slabby face/flank left of the descent and Mixed Up. Start 1m left of Mixed Up and climb directly up the slab to the second col on the skyline, place some gear and traverse right to gain cracks that will deliver you to the third col on the skyline, continue up the easy arete to the top. Mixed Up VD The corner just left of the descent. Follow it to the top. Mixed Up detour S Climb the corner of Mixed Up to a ledge at two thirds height, climb the hand crack in the left wall to the top. Gilesmeister D/VD This route follows the short cracks just left of the descent and right of the corner of Mixed Up. Pinnacles VD This route is right of the descent and starts on a platform a few metres left of a deep zawn. It is the most continuous line on this side of the descent. Up the corner and short little wall to a ledge. You could traverse off left at this point but continue up another little wall to the top. Saucy Baboon S Start 2m right of Pinnacles, climb the corner over several shelves to the top. ==The Slab== Approach: Initially, it is best to approach from the Dursey side along the Beara Way because the crag comes into full view from this side and the approach is more evident. On subsequent visits it is shorter to approach along the Beara way from the Garnish side. The most obvious feature is a large grassy ledge with a few boulders that is at the top of the Bull Wall. A ledge that is above tide (unless there is a swell running) runs along the base of the Bull Wall. The other sections of the crag can be located in relation to the Bull Wall. Description: This is a very pleasant small crag offering low to middle grade climbing in a beautiful setting. Access is easy and the existence of ledges means that it is easy to get around the crag. However, it is necessary to abseil into all routes. This face is to the left of the Bull Wall (facing the crag). It is above a small inlet and has a flat ledge with some large boulders on top. H.O.S. 8m V.Diff R. Stack (Solo) 15/10/95 Abseil in to the base of the climb. Climb the short corner on the left hand side of the slab. Hairy Pink Herrings 25m S A. Forde, R.

Stack 15/10/95 Climb the thin right tending diagonal line to the right of Islands In The Stream(???). A vertical line crosses this route at half height. Protection is poor at the start but the crux is towards the top. ==Bull Wall== There are two ledges under this wall. The square ledge and the long ledge. Abseil into the square ledge. It is possible to climb down to the long ledge from the square ledge. Watch the tide, people have had to scramble up the wall to avoid freak waves. Note : The following routes are above the Square Ledge. Cladonia 15m S R.Stack (Solo) 31/8/95 Start at the left side of the square ledge. Climb the quartz line to the top of the arête. Traverse right to Tralee Dog Show or abseil off. Back Wash 15m HS R.Stack, A. Forde 1/9/95 Start 0.5m right of Cladonia. Climb the right trending line. Samphire 15m HS A.

Abseil in to the bottom of the boulder field and scramble over to the base of the corner. 1. 30m Climb the crack/corner to a narrow ledge. 2. 30m From the ledge climb up and left following the arching line ( tending left). Near the top of the arch traverse left and up to the lip again (poor protection). Climb through a small overhang (quartz) to the top. ==Titan Wall== This is the next wall to the right of Orca wall. All routes have to be abseiled into. About 8m down from the top of the crag there is a long narrow ledge running across the top of the face. It is possible to scramble down to this ledge from the right (as you look at the face) or abseil onto this ledge. From this ledge abseil into the base of the climbs.

            "description": "Directions: From Nohoval Village shop head west, turning left immediately after church at West end of village. Proceed a few hundred metres taking left fork in road. Continue on road for about a mile until you reach a derelict farmhouse. There are two climbing areas presently. The main area is more or less directly south (head up track to top of hill and walk over to main headland, From here turn right walking down to top of cliffs), with secondary area west of the Farmhouse, left of cove, between two big 'Zawns'. Both areas are hard to find for newcomers. Guide below is for Main Area only. Location : Obtain the number 87 “Discovery Series” Ordinance Survey map or equivalent. The crag south of Nohoval village because of the arcane laws governing access to this “hospitable & friendly” green land. (If I did suggest an approach, you might think that I am implying that there is some sort of right of way). History: Marauding Algerian pirates originally discovered this crag in the 17th Century, as an interesting route to terra firma before engaging in a healthy bout of pillaging. Ken in mind. Layout: Barry’s Head proper is a small toe of land projecting east into the sea. However there is also an even smaller second toe of land joined to the first toe but projecting southwest into the sea. The climbs are located at the tip of this second toe. High tide does not affect access to the climbs but rough seas could wash away a belayer or indeed climber not securely attached to the cliff. The climbs range from 10m to 25m in height and are steeper than they first appear. The crag can be roughly divided into three sections: west, south & east sections. A descent can be made using a Difficult route in the south section. Geology: Haven't a notion really. Some sort of sandstone probably, the brighter coloured stuff is nice and grippy. Some, but not all, of the darker stuff can be brittle. Will need to consult with Judith Vonhof on this important matter. The Geological Survey says that at Barry's Head \"A thick sandstone with overlying mudstone is exposed\" Possibly the brighter stuff is the sandstone and the darker stuff is mudstone. ==West Section== On making a descent down the descent route in the South section, traverse rightwards and down and around a corner. To get to the leftmost route on the West Section an easy traverse is made on the boundary between a darker rock below and a brighter more solid looking rock above. All the climbs here begin at this boundary."

The rock bands above the climbs are filled with ledges and jugs. Some caution is advised as these strata are a bit brittle in places. The central climbs (4 to 14) start with delicate and run out sections on slabs and shelves before strenuous arm-pulling and bridging on vertical walls, steep slabs and the odd overhang in the upper sections. The rock is somewhat coarser in texture than that of Black Sabbath Wall and nearby Whiteball Head and where it is free from lichen the frictional qualities are excellent. The routes tend to be much less direct than those at other crags not usually following obvious crack lines. A series of grooves, ramps, corners, short walls and overhangs are what one can expect to encounter. The use of micro-wires is advantageous. For Ecstasy left Wall and the Headwall (which are really named Bunnadoonroe - Bun a'Dún Rua) abseil down the gully on the left (preferably using a minimum 50m rope) and traverse leftwards (looking in) over ledges and easy niches, approximately 3m-4m above high tidal mark. All routes offer good if somewhat spaced protection and holds at times."

Climb the slab just right of the corner, following a series of good cracks until you can move left onto the intermediate ledge (often covered in white guano). Once gained the ledge, it is wise to build an ancor and bring your second up as you will be out of view. Climb the second pitch by following the wall right of the corner, bridging left when necessary, and top out right under the abseil rope (move carefully in the last 5 meters as the rock is less than sound). Abseil from the boulder at the left end of the wall to the last of the standing ledges below (circa 10-12 meters above the water). From the ledge, follow the two twin cracks running above you. Plenty of good gear and excellent hand jams get you to the top section. Once there, stay right of the light grey rock and aim towards the large quartz block above, which provides solid hands to top out. A touch soft in the grade. From the top of the main middle ledge, move diagonally up and left on small but solid feet (delicate) toward a good crack just to the right of the blunt arete. From there, move up to the crack (crux) and follow it to a good rest. Climb up following a series of good holds onto the halfway ledge. Follow the shallow recess and move right of it before topping out. The perfect starter line of the crag. From the main ledge, follow the wide hands crack that splits the middle of the wall (the first 15 meters take only size 3 cams, so either bring plenty of them or be ready to shuffle them up with you as you climb). Past the halfway ledge, climb slightly to the left as the main crack peters out, following a series of good pinches with your right hand. Guillemot *** 40 m HVS 5a Start 2 meters right of “The great Auk”, just right of the deep fissure. Follow the thin crack to a ledge halfway, then continue upward just left of the wide crack and top out trough the licheny bulge near the top. ===Seagull arête area=== From the Main Face, walk backward along the north edge until you can see the obvious arête https://maps.app.goo.gl/iPpyotzjq6wfAsSQ9. Stakes to rappel are found at the top. Careful as the last meters are still a bit loose, move with care near the top. Start at the halfway ledge. Climb the crack one meter right of the arête to the top. Start 2 meters right of Seagull arête crack and climb straight to the top on good holds. To reach the start of the route, abseil past the start of “Seagull arête” into the corner and beyond the roof to a good standing ledge (low tide and/or swell required to stay dry). From the ledge climb the short arête to the roof, which is surmounted by powerful laybacking moves (crux). Enjoy a rest at the base of the corner and climb the latter up to the ledge. It's possible to link it with \"Seagull arête\" for one long 50 meters pitch. ==Bill of Clear== At the western end of the island, the Bill of Clear is a twin pronged rocky headland of excellent sandstone, split by a blowhole cave. https://maps.app.goo.gl/bmEyhvdB4rTXXUdL6 Easy Peasy Corner Severe 16m. At the very end of the furthest jutting section, a modest scramble finds you below a clean cut corner. Its easier than it looks. In Search of the Red Eyed Vireo VS 16m D.Doyle and D.Walsh Sept.'91. This is the crack veering right, on the right hand wall of \"Easy Peasy\". Start at the foot of the corner and go for the crux above the niche. Loads of gear. Phalaropian Tube HS 20m. D.Walsh, D.Doyle Sept. '91. On the inside wall of the outer prong, at the entrance to the blowhole, facing the boilerplate slab, there are some airy ramps descending downwards. Here you'll find a crack and ramp system rending to the right. Start on the ledge at the foot of the crack and climb steeply up to a bulge in the ramp at 10m (crux). From here finish up the ramp. The smaller of the two prongs gas a vertically cracked \"boiler plate\" slab with broken ground on the right. A bleak corner is found still further right, with two small ledges to the bottom and an overlap at 6m. Snow Bunting Severe 35m. D.Walsh, S. Barrett, D.Doyle. Sep.'91. Start on the lower of the two ledges mentioned and climb diagonally up left by footledges to surmount the overlap at 6m. Skip to the left again for 2m to a crack on the extreme edge of the slab, then up the pockmarks to finish up the ramp at the top of the slab. Fastnet Frolic HS 32m D.Walsh, D.Doyle Sept.'91 Start as for \"Snow Bunting\" but go straight up from the first footledge. Continue on over the overlap and up the finger crack in the slab above to finish on the right-hand side of the slab, left of the fourth corner on the top. Dig Out VS 33m. D.Walsh, S.Barrett Sept.'91 Once again start from the lower ledge and climb directly up the steep wall into a shallow scoop at the overlap. Move up into the crux twin cracks to finish directly above the third corner. Lesser Whitethroat Severe 20m. D.Walsh, D.

Where the ledges almost fade out, one can do pleasant mod. to diff. climbing up a series of slight buttresses for about 100m and can then scramble to the top of Cnoc Fiacla. Shadowy Walls 40m Severe F. Winder, Ms E. Healy. 17.8.54 In the north-west corner of Cumeengadhra, between the previous climb and the next one, a gully runs up the back wall. A series of fairly clean walls run up to the right of this. This climb takes an obvious route up these. The details are lost. The first section is at least Severe. Mantle's Edge 65m V.Diff F. Winder, Ms E. Healy. 17.8.54 1. 25m. Climb up the slab to a ledge along which a traverse can be made to the vertical step at the edge. 2. 40m. Climb the step and traverse along a thin line of vegetation for about 20m. Climb back across to a patch of vegetation. Climb straight up from this to the big ledge above. A traverse off was made along this ledge because of time and midges, but the slab could be climbed for about another 30m."

Continue up over the overlap to a block belay. ==Sunday Slab== At the tip of the promontory dividing the Twin Coves. Approach as for West-end buttress. Shortly after passing the tottering pillars (Crumble Corner) go down the headland between the two coves to the top of a fine little slab above the sea. This is Sunday Slab. The slab has a large block at it's base and a crack running up it's center. The first route is about 10m to the west (left facing in) of this slab and takes a crackline up the center of an orange slab which is undercut at the base. On Yer Bike. 14m S S. O Hanlon, F.

From a grassy hollow above the back of the cove scramble down carefully west (right facing out), over grass initially, to reach easy slabs and, finally, good ledges above the high water mark. Move back east on these until below a yellow corner with a continuous crack up the centre. This is the line of Triple Crown. Allez France!. 13m VD G. Moss L.

Climb right-wards over a grey step and move up steeply over a second step. Move back left to finish just right of the top of Triple Crown. Flat-topped Aiguille. 15m. VD L. Convery G. Moss 27/3/04 This route follows the arete on the landward side of the sea-stack. Approach (low tide only) as far as the base of Triple Crown, then descend ledges and cross to the boulders at the foot of the arete. Gain the arete via a short chimney and follow it to the top. Descend by reversing the route. ==Cylinder Cove== This area lies a little west of the Tower. From the Tower follow the field boundary running down towards the sea, to where it ends at the top of a cove ( Boundary Cove). Traverse west passing above another cove (Boulder Cove) and go down to where an obvious cylindrical band of rock caps a short, wide and steep slab. This is Cylinder Slab. or maybe Roly Poly Slab. ===Cylinder Slab=== A lot of activity has seen the creation of five new relatively short routes and some boulder problems on this sheltered slab of rock. It is close to the parking area/main tower; to get to it, heading straight down towards the sea, pass the tower and the small concrete lookout building. Follow the path down to where it peters out. Swing right. Over an old small earth bank/wall go left. The ground steepens. Veer downwards, right and voila, if you have not fallen off the cliff backing the cove, you will have wandered correctly onto the top of the Cylinder or Rolly Poly slab. The climbs are not readily discernable from above. The slab is faced by a smaller slab. These two combine to give an overall V shape. All the climbs start from where these two slabs meet. All the climbs have been done on lead to verify the grade. See the photographs Topo 1 & Topo 2 above. As you look at the slab. Starting on the far left and highest section: Half Banked. S, 10m. Two metres from LHS edge of the slab. Starting under the slightly broken-up overlap. From the bottom of the V (to squeeze out maximum climbing), easy and enjoyable moves on big crimps and edges to the overlap. Crux. Gear beneath overlap. Step up and over. Savàiste Cabàiste. HS, 9m. Thin crack two metres right of Half Banked. The grade is dictated by the sparse gear. Enjoyable climbing up the slab. Stepping over the small, multi-layered, overlap is the crux. Easier and more positive than it looks. No big jugs but all the grips are there. Dig Your Own Hole. VS, 8m. Start at/in the big obvious rectangular cut away cleft. Climb out of this and up to the overlap. The crack appears much more pleasant than it is. No points for guessing where the crux moves are. Sorting out gear for the following crux moves leaves one a little unsure. Once above scamper to the top. Planet of the Scrapes. HVS 5a, 8m. Right of Dig Your Own Hole, obvious crack through the overlap. Another fine crack with the inevitable crux at the overlap. Easy climbing to the overlap. Gear along the way, some “sweet” but not exactly sign posted. The obvious big cut out foothold can be comforting. Climbing through and above the overlap is somewhat strenuous and committing. White Quartz holds and a finger tip crack are the plat de jour on the crux. A long reach for a jug-hold from the climbing Gods. And then you are up. Shaking and laughing. MFA Cave & Roof. E1/5b, 8m. An obvious feature of the slab is the 2 metre wide, one metre deep cave. Essentially follow the right hand side crack through the cave roof and the overlap above this. Starting at the back of the cave, climb up through the roof and onto the small face above. Protectable but strenuous climbing. From this squatting position place the gear (possible nut and cam) to protect the step-up moves to the crux, which is climbing over and up from the next big overlap. Committing, pumpy and sustained, this is a gem of a climb with, if it is of any comfort, a bomber belay at the top. The Rolly Poly Boulder Problems. Further right there are four boulder problems, probably going at 4b up to 5a. They tackle the weaknesses in the overlap. Which at the middle-right end of the slab, sticks out about .5m and is no more than 2-3m high. The 4b problem is the biggest crack with the big jugs and an arm-jam. Flanking this problem on either side there are two other problems. These rely on quartz finger holds and stretchy step ups. Enjoyable tests of ones bouldering mettle. The fourth is a bit of a highball problem. This problem lies about 2m left of the 4b problem (looking at it). More fingery stuff above the overlap. A long committing reach is required to reach the top and the subsequent respect. The AK Traverse. Below Cylinder Slab there are four slabs. These are described from west to E, (left to right facing in). A. Easy Slab. Below the west end of Cylinder Slab. An easy scramble down this short slab provides access to a ledge system (uncovered for fours hours either side of low tide) leading to the following two slabs. B. Cleft Slab. The next slab to the right. (Easily identified by the half-meter wide cleft splitting the slab from top to bottom). Serrated Flakes. VD L. Convery G. Moss 15/6/03 Climbs the right facing corner to the left of the cleft, using a series of small flakes and the crack. AOS Slab Route 6m VS Terence Hoare A gearless solo. Truly wonderful on tinies and friction at just the right angle, although it does steepen in the middle. A great route. Cleft Right. S G. Moss L. Convery 15/6/03 Climbs the right edge of the cleft. Poor protection. Two gearless eliminate routes squeezed on to the blank slab between Cleft Right and W.M.D worth recording. (These may have been climbed before) 1.Moonwalk. (HS). Start 1m right of 'Cleft right' on a large block at the base of the slab. Climb delicately up the slab trending rightward after 2/3 height to a break. Finish up the slab above. 2.To boldly go (VS). Start below the block at its right end. Move delicately straight W.M.D. VS 4b G. Moss L. Convery 15/6/03 Start below two thin parallel cracks near the right edge of the slab. Climb the right-hand crack then the left crack to where it ends. Delicate moves right gain the edge which is followed to a break. Climb the final section on small holds. Sparse protection. W.M.D. Direct VS 4c Climb to the end of the left hand crack and move directly and delicately upwards using two small quartz veins. finish as for above. (This may have been done before, M. Donnelly April/11) C. Starfish Slab. The next slab to the right. Eureka. D. L. Convery G. Moss15/6/03 Climb the right facing corner on the left edge of the slab. The Milky Way. HS 4a G. Moss M. Casey, J. Reville 6/11/10 Start as for Eureka, at the foot of the corner. Move up and traverse R along a narrow footledge to the centre of the slab. Climb straight up, following vague cracks, with widely spaced protection. Star Wars. HS. 4a G. Moss L. Convery 26/10/03 Start 2m right of the corner. Climb diagonally right to gain the right edge of the slab. Follow this over a slight bulge to a break and runner. Continue up the edge to finish. D. Narrow Slab. The next slab to the right. Access is by abseil. Thanks, Dave. D. L. Convery G. Moss 15/6/03 The right facing corner on the left edge of the slab. ==Tower Slabs== ===Tower Slab West=== Follow the field boundary below the Tower to where it ends above a large cove (Boundary Cove). Tower Slab West is the slab immediately east of the cove (left facing out). Abseil down the centre of the slab to a ledge with a short wall behind it (about 23m). The following four routes all start from this ledge. Snap Apple. 30m S G. Moss L. Convery 26/10/03 Climb diagonally left to gain a short black corner on the left edge of the slab.. From the top of the corner follow the edge over a small overhang to a stance. Step down left to gain the foot of a narrow subsidiary slab and climb this near it's left edge to a crack on the right. Pull over a block to finish. Snap Apple Agag. 25m. S L. Convery G. Moss 26/10/03 Takes the thin crack about 1.5m right of the wide crack splitting the slab. Follow the crack to where it fades below a small overlap. Step up left to reach an edge (crux) and continue directly to the top. Pinkie. 25m. HS P.Britton, L. Convery G. Moss 25/10/03 Start 2m in from the right edge below a thin crack. Follow the crack delicately to the overlap. Surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. Trick or Treat. 25m. VD. G. Moss L. Convery P.B. 25/10/03. Start as for Pinkie. Climb diagonally right to the edge and follow this to the top. Poor protection. The foot of the next route, which is on a lower, subsidiary slab, is reached by scrambling on down from the ledge at the foot of the main slab. White Horses 10m. D. L. Convery G. Moss 25/10/03 Climb the centre crack. Scramble off right. ===Tower Slab East=== From the top of Tower Slab west move east (left facing out), passing the head of a narrow inlet and scramble down over easy slabs, moving back west to the base of the long slab bordering the inlet. A = Cúinne Murchadh. B = Assume The Position. Assume the position. 25m S G. Moss L. Convery 24/9/03 Start from a ledge at the bottom of the slab (half to low tide only). Climb left to gain the left edge and follow this, in an airy position, to where the inlet ends. Continue up the wide crack . Cinne Murchadh. 25m. S L. Convery G. Moss 24/9/03. Start as for above. Climb the left facing corner to where the crack widens and the angle eases, at about 18m. Move up and right through a break in the wall on the right and climb the slab and corner to the top. ===Broad Slab=== The slab 15m east (left facing out) of Tower Slabs. At Swim Two Birds. 25m. VS 4b. G. Moss L. Convery 14/6/03 Climb the long diagonal crack on the right facing sidewall overlooking the left side of Broad Slab. Full Moon Knockadoon. 30m. HVS 4c. Between the seals and the dogs, Crack and slab just left of the Mod, The micros are in, The flakes are quite thin, If that’s a jug then thanks be to god. Ó Bhun go Barr. 35m M L. Convery G. Moss 14/6/03 The long crackline up the center of Broad Slab. The following two climbs are further east, full details later. Black Wall Chimney. 15m. S. G. Moss L. Convery 14/6/03 Climb the chimney at the right hand end of Black Wall. Slab & Overhang. 15m. VD G. Moss L. Convery 14/6/03 To the right of Black Wall. Climb a slab to the foot of a short overhang on the right. Over this on good holds. ==Topos by Gerry Moss== Image: KADmap1.JPG ---- Image: KADmap2.JPG ---- Image: KADmap3.JPG ---- Image: KADmap5.JPG ---- Image: KADmap6.JPG Topo 1: Topo 2: NOTE: Knockadoon is a nice place to climb with easy access. The climbs however are rather short in places, especially the Sunday slabs which if were two or three times longer would be out of this world, and they are a lot easier than they appear. It does nicely for one day's climbing and you could climb at Ardmore the second day which is across the bay. Tim O'Connell"

The fourth is a bit of a highball problem. This problem lies about 2m left of the 4b problem (looking at it). More fingery stuff above the overlap. A long committing reach is required to reach the top and the subsequent respect. The AK Traverse. Below Cylinder Slab there are four slabs. These are described from west to E, (left to right facing in). A. Easy Slab. Below the west end of Cylinder Slab. An easy scramble down this short slab provides access to a ledge system (uncovered for fours hours either side of low tide) leading to the following two slabs. B. Cleft Slab. The next slab to the right. (Easily identified by the half-meter wide cleft splitting the slab from top to bottom). Serrated Flakes. VD L. Convery G. Moss 15/6/03 Climbs the right facing corner to the left of the cleft, using a series of small flakes and the crack. AOS Slab Route 6m VS Terence Hoare A gearless solo. Truly wonderful on tinies and friction at just the right angle, although it does steepen in the middle. A great route. Cleft Right. S G. Moss L. Convery 15/6/03 Climbs the right edge of the cleft. Poor protection. Two gearless eliminate routes squeezed on to the blank slab between Cleft Right and W.M.D worth recording. (These may have been climbed before) 1.Moonwalk. (HS). Start 1m right of 'Cleft right' on a large block at the base of the slab. Climb delicately up the slab trending rightward after 2/3 height to a break. Finish up the slab above. 2.To boldly go (VS). Start below the block at its right end. Move delicately straight W.M.D. VS 4b G. Moss L. Convery 15/6/03 Start below two thin parallel cracks near the right edge of the slab. Climb the right-hand crack then the left crack to where it ends. Delicate moves right gain the edge which is followed to a break. Climb the final section on small holds. Sparse protection. W.M.D. Direct VS 4c Climb to the end of the left hand crack and move directly and delicately upwards using two small quartz veins. finish as for above. (This may have been done before, M. Donnelly April/11) C. Starfish Slab. The next slab to the right. Eureka. D. L. Convery G. Moss15/6/03 Climb the right facing corner on the left edge of the slab. The Milky Way. HS 4a G. Moss M. Casey, J. Reville 6/11/10 Start as for Eureka, at the foot of the corner. Move up and traverse R along a narrow footledge to the centre of the slab. Climb straight up, following vague cracks, with widely spaced protection. Star Wars. HS. 4a G. Moss L. Convery 26/10/03 Start 2m right of the corner. Climb diagonally right to gain the right edge of the slab. Follow this over a slight bulge to a break and runner. Continue up the edge to finish. D. Narrow Slab. The next slab to the right. Access is by abseil. Thanks, Dave. D. L. Convery G. Moss 15/6/03 The right facing corner on the left edge of the slab. ==Tower Slabs== ===Tower Slab West=== Follow the field boundary below the Tower to where it ends above a large cove (Boundary Cove). Tower Slab West is the slab immediately east of the cove (left facing out). Abseil down the centre of the slab to a ledge with a short wall behind it (about 23m). The following four routes all start from this ledge. Snap Apple. 30m S G. Moss L. Convery 26/10/03 Climb diagonally left to gain a short black corner on the left edge of the slab.. From the top of the corner follow the edge over a small overhang to a stance. Step down left to gain the foot of a narrow subsidiary slab and climb this near it's left edge to a crack on the right. Pull over a block to finish. Snap Apple Agag. 25m. S L. Convery G. Moss 26/10/03 Takes the thin crack about 1.5m right of the wide crack splitting the slab. Follow the crack to where it fades below a small overlap. Step up left to reach an edge (crux) and continue directly to the top. Pinkie. 25m. HS P.Britton, L. Convery G. Moss 25/10/03 Start 2m in from the right edge below a thin crack. Follow the crack delicately to the overlap. Surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. Trick or Treat. 25m. VD. G. Moss L. Convery P.B. 25/10/03. Start as for Pinkie. Climb diagonally right to the edge and follow this to the top. Poor protection. The foot of the next route, which is on a lower, subsidiary slab, is reached by scrambling on down from the ledge at the foot of the main slab. White Horses 10m. D. L. Convery G. Moss 25/10/03 Climb the centre crack. Scramble off right. ===Tower Slab East=== From the top of Tower Slab west move east (left facing out), passing the head of a narrow inlet and scramble down over easy slabs, moving back west to the base of the long slab bordering the inlet. A = Cúinne Murchadh. B = Assume The Position. Assume the position. 25m S G. Moss L. Convery 24/9/03 Start from a ledge at the bottom of the slab (half to low tide only). Climb left to gain the left edge and follow this, in an airy position, to where the inlet ends. Continue up the wide crack . Cinne Murchadh. 25m. S L. Convery G. Moss 24/9/03. Start as for above. Climb the left facing corner to where the crack widens and the angle eases, at about 18m. Move up and right through a break in the wall on the right and climb the slab and corner to the top. ===Broad Slab=== The slab 15m east (left facing out) of Tower Slabs. At Swim Two Birds. 25m. VS 4b. G. Moss L. Convery 14/6/03 Climb the long diagonal crack on the right facing sidewall overlooking the left side of Broad Slab. Full Moon Knockadoon. 30m. HVS 4c.

Moss 14/6/03 The long crackline up the center of Broad Slab. The following two climbs are further east, full details later. Black Wall Chimney. 15m. S. G. Moss L. Convery 14/6/03 Climb the chimney at the right hand end of Black Wall. Slab & Overhang. 15m. VD G. Moss L. Convery 14/6/03 To the right of Black Wall. Climb a slab to the foot of a short overhang on the right. Over this on good holds. ==Topos by Gerry Moss== Image: KADmap1.JPG ---- Image: KADmap2.JPG ---- Image: KADmap3.JPG ---- Image: KADmap5.JPG ---- Image: KADmap6.JPG Topo 1: Topo 2: NOTE: Knockadoon is a nice place to climb with easy access. The climbs however are rather short in places, especially the Sunday slabs which if were two or three times longer would be out of this world, and they are a lot easier than they appear. It does nicely for one day's climbing and you could climb at Ardmore the second day which is across the bay. Tim O'Connell"

O Hanlon, G. Moss. 17/08/03 The thin crack just inside the right edge. ==Sea-Stack Cove== The cove to the east of Twin Coves easily identifiable by the sea-stack. Approach. From a grassy hollow above the back of the cove scramble down carefully west (right facing out), over grass initially, to reach easy slabs and, finally, good ledges above the high water mark. Move back east on these until below a yellow corner with a continuous crack up the centre. This is the line of Triple Crown. Allez France!. 13m VD G. Moss L. Convery 28/3/04 Start beneath the corner crack. Climb diagonally left up a slab to the foot of a ramp sloping up right. Climb the ramp and exit left via a crack. Block belay 3m back. Triple Crown. 13m S L. Convery G. Moss 28/3/04 Start below the crack, which is climbed to the top. Belay as for Le Cocq. Grand Slam. 14m S G. Moss L. Convery 28/3/04 Start as for Triple Crown. Climb right-wards over a grey step and move up steeply over a second step. Move back left to finish just right of the top of Triple Crown. Flat-topped Aiguille. 15m. VD L. Convery G. Moss 27/3/04 This route follows the arete on the landward side of the sea-stack. Approach (low tide only) as far as the base of Triple Crown, then descend ledges and cross to the boulders at the foot of the arete. Gain the arete via a short chimney and follow it to the top. Descend by reversing the route. ==Cylinder Cove== This area lies a little west of the Tower. From the Tower follow the field boundary running down towards the sea, to where it ends at the top of a cove ( Boundary Cove). Traverse west passing above another cove (Boulder Cove) and go down to where an obvious cylindrical band of rock caps a short, wide and steep slab. This is Cylinder Slab. or maybe Roly Poly Slab. ===Cylinder Slab=== A lot of activity has seen the creation of five new relatively short routes and some boulder problems on this sheltered slab of rock. It is close to the parking area/main tower; to get to it, heading straight down towards the sea, pass the tower and the small concrete lookout building. Follow the path down to where it peters out. Swing right. Over an old small earth bank/wall go left. The ground steepens. Veer downwards, right and voila, if you have not fallen off the cliff backing the cove, you will have wandered correctly onto the top of the Cylinder or Rolly Poly slab. The climbs are not readily discernable from above. The slab is faced by a smaller slab. These two combine to give an overall V shape. All the climbs start from where these two slabs meet. All the climbs have been done on lead to verify the grade. See the photographs Topo 1 & Topo 2 above. As you look at the slab. Starting on the far left and highest section: Half Banked. S, 10m. Two metres from LHS edge of the slab. Starting under the slightly broken-up overlap. From the bottom of the V (to squeeze out maximum climbing), easy and enjoyable moves on big crimps and edges to the overlap. Crux. Gear beneath overlap. Step up and over. Savàiste Cabàiste. HS, 9m. Thin crack two metres right of Half Banked. The grade is dictated by the sparse gear. Enjoyable climbing up the slab. Stepping over the small, multi-layered, overlap is the crux. Easier and more positive than it looks. No big jugs but all the grips are there. Dig Your Own Hole. VS, 8m. Start at/in the big obvious rectangular cut away cleft. Climb out of this and up to the overlap. The crack appears much more pleasant than it is. No points for guessing where the crux moves are. Sorting out gear for the following crux moves leaves one a little unsure. Once above scamper to the top. Planet of the Scrapes. HVS 5a, 8m. Right of Dig Your Own Hole, obvious crack through the overlap. Another fine crack with the inevitable crux at the overlap. Easy climbing to the overlap. Gear along the way, some “sweet” but not exactly sign posted. The obvious big cut out foothold can be comforting. Climbing through and above the overlap is somewhat strenuous and committing. White Quartz holds and a finger tip crack are the plat de jour on the crux. A long reach for a jug-hold from the climbing Gods. And then you are up. Shaking and laughing. MFA Cave & Roof. E1/5b, 8m. An obvious feature of the slab is the 2 metre wide, one metre deep cave. Essentially follow the right hand side crack through the cave roof and the overlap above this. Starting at the back of the cave, climb up through the roof and onto the small face above. Protectable but strenuous climbing. From this squatting position place the gear (possible nut and cam) to protect the step-up moves to the crux, which is climbing over and up from the next big overlap. Committing, pumpy and sustained, this is a gem of a climb with, if it is of any comfort, a bomber belay at the top. The Rolly Poly Boulder Problems. Further right there are four boulder problems, probably going at 4b up to 5a. They tackle the weaknesses in the overlap. Which at the middle-right end of the slab, sticks out about .5m and is no more than 2-3m high. The 4b problem is the biggest crack with the big jugs and an arm-jam. Flanking this problem on either side there are two other problems. These rely on quartz finger holds and stretchy step ups. Enjoyable tests of ones bouldering mettle. The fourth is a bit of a highball problem. This problem lies about 2m left of the 4b problem (looking at it). More fingery stuff above the overlap. A long committing reach is required to reach the top and the subsequent respect. The AK Traverse. Below Cylinder Slab there are four slabs. These are described from west to E, (left to right facing in). A. Easy Slab. Below the west end of Cylinder Slab. An easy scramble down this short slab provides access to a ledge system (uncovered for fours hours either side of low tide) leading to the following two slabs. B. Cleft Slab. The next slab to the right. (Easily identified by the half-meter wide cleft splitting the slab from top to bottom). Serrated Flakes. VD L. Convery G. Moss 15/6/03 Climbs the right facing corner to the left of the cleft, using a series of small flakes and the crack. AOS Slab Route 6m VS Terence Hoare A gearless solo. Truly wonderful on tinies and friction at just the right angle, although it does steepen in the middle. A great route. Cleft Right. S G. Moss L. Convery 15/6/03 Climbs the right edge of the cleft. Poor protection. Two gearless eliminate routes squeezed on to the blank slab between Cleft Right and W.M.D worth recording. (These may have been climbed before) 1.Moonwalk. (HS). Start 1m right of 'Cleft right' on a large block at the base of the slab. Climb delicately up the slab trending rightward after 2/3 height to a break. Finish up the slab above. 2.To boldly go (VS). Start below the block at its right end. Move delicately straight W.M.D. VS 4b G. Moss L. Convery 15/6/03 Start below two thin parallel cracks near the right edge of the slab. Climb the right-hand crack then the left crack to where it ends. Delicate moves right gain the edge which is followed to a break. Climb the final section on small holds. Sparse protection. W.M.D. Direct VS 4c Climb to the end of the left hand crack and move directly and delicately upwards using two small quartz veins. finish as for above. (This may have been done before, M. Donnelly April/11) C. Starfish Slab. The next slab to the right. Eureka. D. L. Convery G. Moss15/6/03 Climb the right facing corner on the left edge of the slab. The Milky Way. HS 4a G. Moss M. Casey, J. Reville 6/11/10 Start as for Eureka, at the foot of the corner. Move up and traverse R along a narrow footledge to the centre of the slab. Climb straight up, following vague cracks, with widely spaced protection. Star Wars. HS. 4a G. Moss L. Convery 26/10/03 Start 2m right of the corner. Climb diagonally right to gain the right edge of the slab. Follow this over a slight bulge to a break and runner. Continue up the edge to finish. D. Narrow Slab. The next slab to the right. Access is by abseil. Thanks, Dave. D. L. Convery G. Moss 15/6/03 The right facing corner on the left edge of the slab. ==Tower Slabs== ===Tower Slab West=== Follow the field boundary below the Tower to where it ends above a large cove (Boundary Cove). Tower Slab West is the slab immediately east of the cove (left facing out). Abseil down the centre of the slab to a ledge with a short wall behind it (about 23m). The following four routes all start from this ledge. Snap Apple. 30m S G. Moss L. Convery 26/10/03 Climb diagonally left to gain a short black corner on the left edge of the slab.. From the top of the corner follow the edge over a small overhang to a stance. Step down left to gain the foot of a narrow subsidiary slab and climb this near it's left edge to a crack on the right. Pull over a block to finish. Snap Apple Agag. 25m. S L. Convery G. Moss 26/10/03 Takes the thin crack about 1.5m right of the wide crack splitting the slab. Follow the crack to where it fades below a small overlap. Step up left to reach an edge (crux) and continue directly to the top. Pinkie. 25m. HS P.Britton, L. Convery G. Moss 25/10/03 Start 2m in from the right edge below a thin crack. Follow the crack delicately to the overlap. Surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. Trick or Treat. 25m. VD. G. Moss L. Convery P.B. 25/10/03. Start as for Pinkie. Climb diagonally right to the edge and follow this to the top. Poor protection. The foot of the next route, which is on a lower, subsidiary slab, is reached by scrambling on down from the ledge at the foot of the main slab. White Horses 10m. D. L. Convery G. Moss 25/10/03 Climb the centre crack. Scramble off right. ===Tower Slab East=== From the top of Tower Slab west move east (left facing out), passing the head of a narrow inlet and scramble down over easy slabs, moving back west to the base of the long slab bordering the inlet. A = Cúinne Murchadh. B = Assume The Position. Assume the position. 25m S G. Moss L. Convery 24/9/03 Start from a ledge at the bottom of the slab (half to low tide only). Climb left to gain the left edge and follow this, in an airy position, to where the inlet ends. Continue up the wide crack . Cinne Murchadh. 25m. S L. Convery G. Moss 24/9/03. Start as for above. Climb the left facing corner to where the crack widens and the angle eases, at about 18m. Move up and right through a break in the wall on the right and climb the slab and corner to the top. ===Broad Slab=== The slab 15m east (left facing out) of Tower Slabs. At Swim Two Birds. 25m. VS 4b. G. Moss L. Convery 14/6/03 Climb the long diagonal crack on the right facing sidewall overlooking the left side of Broad Slab. Full Moon Knockadoon. 30m. HVS 4c.

Climb the ramp and exit left via a crack. Block belay 3m back. Triple Crown. 13m S L. Convery G. Moss 28/3/04 Start below the crack, which is climbed to the top. Belay as for Le Cocq. Grand Slam. 14m S G. Moss L. Convery 28/3/04 Start as for Triple Crown. Climb right-wards over a grey step and move up steeply over a second step. Move back left to finish just right of the top of Triple Crown. Flat-topped Aiguille. 15m. VD L. Convery G. Moss 27/3/04 This route follows the arete on the landward side of the sea-stack. Approach (low tide only) as far as the base of Triple Crown, then descend ledges and cross to the boulders at the foot of the arete. Gain the arete via a short chimney and follow it to the top. Descend by reversing the route. ==Cylinder Cove== This area lies a little west of the Tower. From the Tower follow the field boundary running down towards the sea, to where it ends at the top of a cove ( Boundary Cove). Traverse west passing above another cove (Boulder Cove) and go down to where an obvious cylindrical band of rock caps a short, wide and steep slab. This is Cylinder Slab. or maybe Roly Poly Slab. ===Cylinder Slab=== A lot of activity has seen the creation of five new relatively short routes and some boulder problems on this sheltered slab of rock. It is close to the parking area/main tower; to get to it, heading straight down towards the sea, pass the tower and the small concrete lookout building. Follow the path down to where it peters out. Swing right. Over an old small earth bank/wall go left. The ground steepens. Veer downwards, right and voila, if you have not fallen off the cliff backing the cove, you will have wandered correctly onto the top of the Cylinder or Rolly Poly slab. The climbs are not readily discernable from above. The slab is faced by a smaller slab. These two combine to give an overall V shape. All the climbs start from where these two slabs meet. All the climbs have been done on lead to verify the grade. See the photographs Topo 1 & Topo 2 above. As you look at the slab. Starting on the far left and highest section: Half Banked. S, 10m. Two metres from LHS edge of the slab. Starting under the slightly broken-up overlap. From the bottom of the V (to squeeze out maximum climbing), easy and enjoyable moves on big crimps and edges to the overlap. Crux. Gear beneath overlap. Step up and over. Savàiste Cabàiste. HS, 9m. Thin crack two metres right of Half Banked. The grade is dictated by the sparse gear. Enjoyable climbing up the slab. Stepping over the small, multi-layered, overlap is the crux. Easier and more positive than it looks. No big jugs but all the grips are there. Dig Your Own Hole. VS, 8m. Start at/in the big obvious rectangular cut away cleft. Climb out of this and up to the overlap. The crack appears much more pleasant than it is. No points for guessing where the crux moves are. Sorting out gear for the following crux moves leaves one a little unsure. Once above scamper to the top. Planet of the Scrapes. HVS 5a, 8m. Right of Dig Your Own Hole, obvious crack through the overlap. Another fine crack with the inevitable crux at the overlap. Easy climbing to the overlap. Gear along the way, some “sweet” but not exactly sign posted. The obvious big cut out foothold can be comforting. Climbing through and above the overlap is somewhat strenuous and committing. White Quartz holds and a finger tip crack are the plat de jour on the crux. A long reach for a jug-hold from the climbing Gods. And then you are up. Shaking and laughing. MFA Cave & Roof. E1/5b, 8m. An obvious feature of the slab is the 2 metre wide, one metre deep cave. Essentially follow the right hand side crack through the cave roof and the overlap above this. Starting at the back of the cave, climb up through the roof and onto the small face above. Protectable but strenuous climbing. From this squatting position place the gear (possible nut and cam) to protect the step-up moves to the crux, which is climbing over and up from the next big overlap. Committing, pumpy and sustained, this is a gem of a climb with, if it is of any comfort, a bomber belay at the top. The Rolly Poly Boulder Problems. Further right there are four boulder problems, probably going at 4b up to 5a. They tackle the weaknesses in the overlap. Which at the middle-right end of the slab, sticks out about .5m and is no more than 2-3m high. The 4b problem is the biggest crack with the big jugs and an arm-jam. Flanking this problem on either side there are two other problems. These rely on quartz finger holds and stretchy step ups. Enjoyable tests of ones bouldering mettle. The fourth is a bit of a highball problem. This problem lies about 2m left of the 4b problem (looking at it). More fingery stuff above the overlap. A long committing reach is required to reach the top and the subsequent respect. The AK Traverse. Below Cylinder Slab there are four slabs. These are described from west to E, (left to right facing in). A. Easy Slab. Below the west end of Cylinder Slab. An easy scramble down this short slab provides access to a ledge system (uncovered for fours hours either side of low tide) leading to the following two slabs. B. Cleft Slab. The next slab to the right. (Easily identified by the half-meter wide cleft splitting the slab from top to bottom). Serrated Flakes. VD L. Convery G. Moss 15/6/03 Climbs the right facing corner to the left of the cleft, using a series of small flakes and the crack. AOS Slab Route 6m VS Terence Hoare A gearless solo. Truly wonderful on tinies and friction at just the right angle, although it does steepen in the middle. A great route. Cleft Right. S G. Moss L. Convery 15/6/03 Climbs the right edge of the cleft. Poor protection. Two gearless eliminate routes squeezed on to the blank slab between Cleft Right and W.M.D worth recording. (These may have been climbed before) 1.Moonwalk. (HS). Start 1m right of 'Cleft right' on a large block at the base of the slab. Climb delicately up the slab trending rightward after 2/3 height to a break. Finish up the slab above. 2.To boldly go (VS). Start below the block at its right end. Move delicately straight W.M.D. VS 4b G. Moss L. Convery 15/6/03 Start below two thin parallel cracks near the right edge of the slab. Climb the right-hand crack then the left crack to where it ends. Delicate moves right gain the edge which is followed to a break. Climb the final section on small holds. Sparse protection. W.M.D. Direct VS 4c Climb to the end of the left hand crack and move directly and delicately upwards using two small quartz veins. finish as for above. (This may have been done before, M. Donnelly April/11) C. Starfish Slab. The next slab to the right. Eureka. D. L. Convery G. Moss15/6/03 Climb the right facing corner on the left edge of the slab. The Milky Way. HS 4a G. Moss M. Casey, J. Reville 6/11/10 Start as for Eureka, at the foot of the corner. Move up and traverse R along a narrow footledge to the centre of the slab. Climb straight up, following vague cracks, with widely spaced protection. Star Wars. HS. 4a G. Moss L. Convery 26/10/03 Start 2m right of the corner. Climb diagonally right to gain the right edge of the slab. Follow this over a slight bulge to a break and runner. Continue up the edge to finish. D. Narrow Slab. The next slab to the right. Access is by abseil. Thanks, Dave. D. L. Convery G. Moss 15/6/03 The right facing corner on the left edge of the slab. ==Tower Slabs== ===Tower Slab West=== Follow the field boundary below the Tower to where it ends above a large cove (Boundary Cove). Tower Slab West is the slab immediately east of the cove (left facing out). Abseil down the centre of the slab to a ledge with a short wall behind it (about 23m). The following four routes all start from this ledge. Snap Apple. 30m S G. Moss L. Convery 26/10/03 Climb diagonally left to gain a short black corner on the left edge of the slab.. From the top of the corner follow the edge over a small overhang to a stance. Step down left to gain the foot of a narrow subsidiary slab and climb this near it's left edge to a crack on the right. Pull over a block to finish. Snap Apple Agag. 25m. S L. Convery G. Moss 26/10/03 Takes the thin crack about 1.5m right of the wide crack splitting the slab. Follow the crack to where it fades below a small overlap. Step up left to reach an edge (crux) and continue directly to the top. Pinkie. 25m. HS P.Britton, L. Convery G. Moss 25/10/03 Start 2m in from the right edge below a thin crack. Follow the crack delicately to the overlap. Surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. Trick or Treat. 25m. VD. G. Moss L. Convery P.B. 25/10/03. Start as for Pinkie. Climb diagonally right to the edge and follow this to the top. Poor protection. The foot of the next route, which is on a lower, subsidiary slab, is reached by scrambling on down from the ledge at the foot of the main slab. White Horses 10m. D. L. Convery G. Moss 25/10/03 Climb the centre crack. Scramble off right. ===Tower Slab East=== From the top of Tower Slab west move east (left facing out), passing the head of a narrow inlet and scramble down over easy slabs, moving back west to the base of the long slab bordering the inlet. A = Cúinne Murchadh. B = Assume The Position. Assume the position. 25m S G. Moss L. Convery 24/9/03 Start from a ledge at the bottom of the slab (half to low tide only). Climb left to gain the left edge and follow this, in an airy position, to where the inlet ends. Continue up the wide crack . Cinne Murchadh. 25m. S L. Convery G. Moss 24/9/03. Start as for above. Climb the left facing corner to where the crack widens and the angle eases, at about 18m. Move up and right through a break in the wall on the right and climb the slab and corner to the top. ===Broad Slab=== The slab 15m east (left facing out) of Tower Slabs. At Swim Two Birds. 25m. VS 4b. G. Moss L. Convery 14/6/03 Climb the long diagonal crack on the right facing sidewall overlooking the left side of Broad Slab. Full Moon Knockadoon. 30m. HVS 4c. Between the seals and the dogs, Crack and slab just left of the Mod, The micros are in, The flakes are quite thin, If that’s a jug then thanks be to god. Ó Bhun go Barr. 35m M L. Convery G. Moss 14/6/03 The long crackline up the center of Broad Slab. The following two climbs are further east, full details later. Black Wall Chimney. 15m. S. G. Moss L. Convery 14/6/03 Climb the chimney at the right hand end of Black Wall. Slab & Overhang. 15m. VD G. Moss L. Convery 14/6/03 To the right of Black Wall.

Moss 15/6/03 The right facing corner on the left edge of the slab. ==Tower Slabs== ===Tower Slab West=== Follow the field boundary below the Tower to where it ends above a large cove (Boundary Cove). Tower Slab West is the slab immediately east of the cove (left facing out). Abseil down the centre of the slab to a ledge with a short wall behind it (about 23m). The following four routes all start from this ledge. Snap Apple. 30m S G. Moss L. Convery 26/10/03 Climb diagonally left to gain a short black corner on the left edge of the slab.. From the top of the corner follow the edge over a small overhang to a stance. Step down left to gain the foot of a narrow subsidiary slab and climb this near it's left edge to a crack on the right. Pull over a block to finish. Snap Apple Agag. 25m. S L. Convery G. Moss 26/10/03 Takes the thin crack about 1.5m right of the wide crack splitting the slab. Follow the crack to where it fades below a small overlap. Step up left to reach an edge (crux) and continue directly to the top. Pinkie. 25m. HS P.Britton, L. Convery G. Moss 25/10/03 Start 2m in from the right edge below a thin crack. Follow the crack delicately to the overlap. Surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. Trick or Treat. 25m. VD. G. Moss L. Convery P.B. 25/10/03. Start as for Pinkie. Climb diagonally right to the edge and follow this to the top. Poor protection. The foot of the next route, which is on a lower, subsidiary slab, is reached by scrambling on down from the ledge at the foot of the main slab. White Horses 10m. D. L. Convery G. Moss 25/10/03 Climb the centre crack. Scramble off right. ===Tower Slab East=== From the top of Tower Slab west move east (left facing out), passing the head of a narrow inlet and scramble down over easy slabs, moving back west to the base of the long slab bordering the inlet. A = Cúinne Murchadh. B = Assume The Position. Assume the position. 25m S G. Moss L. Convery 24/9/03 Start from a ledge at the bottom of the slab (half to low tide only). Climb left to gain the left edge and follow this, in an airy position, to where the inlet ends. Continue up the wide crack . Cinne Murchadh. 25m. S L. Convery G. Moss 24/9/03. Start as for above. Climb the left facing corner to where the crack widens and the angle eases, at about 18m. Move up and right through a break in the wall on the right and climb the slab and corner to the top. ===Broad Slab=== The slab 15m east (left facing out) of Tower Slabs. At Swim Two Birds. 25m. VS 4b. G. Moss L. Convery 14/6/03 Climb the long diagonal crack on the right facing sidewall overlooking the left side of Broad Slab. Full Moon Knockadoon. 30m. HVS 4c. Between the seals and the dogs, Crack and slab just left of the Mod, The micros are in, The flakes are quite thin, If that’s a jug then thanks be to god. Ó Bhun go Barr. 35m M L. Convery G. Moss 14/6/03 The long crackline up the center of Broad Slab. The following two climbs are further east, full details later. Black Wall Chimney. 15m. S. G. Moss L. Convery 14/6/03 Climb the chimney at the right hand end of Black Wall. Slab & Overhang. 15m. VD G. Moss L. Convery 14/6/03 To the right of Black Wall. Climb a slab to the foot of a short overhang on the right.

The climbs however are rather short in places, especially the Sunday slabs which if were two or three times longer would be out of this world, and they are a lot easier than they appear.

Move up to a rest at a small crack in the slab. Climb the slab keeping to the right hand side. Very delicate. Some protection is available at the overlap and a poor RP runner above. A route giving relief rather than satisfaction. 13 ** Arrowhead No. 2 20m S (3c) P. Long, D. O’Sullivan The route goes up to and through the large obvious arrowhead about half-way along the cliff. Above the arrowhead the route follows the relatively large corner to the top. Protection is fairly good but the climb may appear fairly hard for its grade. Left of the arrowhead the cliff is divided into two halves by a small overlap. Above this is a smooth slab, below an easier more broken slab. About 5 metres right of the arrowhead on climb 13 is an obvious large crack, the Táin Bó Cuailnge (or Piton Crack). 14 *** Song of the Sea 21m VS (4c) D. O’Connell, S.

Cross the compound wall at the bricked-up point and follow the wall on your left to the top of the crag. At this point is a large ledge (sometimes slippery) with a large boulder. Climbs in this are mainly steep wall and slab climbs. Most are short but afford good sport. The tide can affect climbing in this area, especially in rough weather. It is not possible to climb here if there is a high sea running. The base of the crag can be reached most easily by continuing out the headland until it is possible to climb down easily (not possible at high tide). The chimney at the headland end of the base-camp ledge can be down-climbed (Black Cleft) but is not easy and an abseil descent is probably safer. 800px"

Over time, millions of other residents move in on top of you. You resist joining the residents committee but after an age the pressure becomes unbearable and you and your fellow residents become one. Actually I don’t have a clue about the geology but the rock is generally good solid stuff to clamber about on. Development Scope The big wall has some 'nice looking' lines available. E1 grade leaders have been defeated here, so may be higher in the grad. Lost Wall area has another wall further East of it with steep cracks that also have rejected said leaders. Other routes could be contrived from the whole Roberts Head area generally. It has a strange tendency to reveal new routes the more you climb there. ==Upper Tier== A 6m high section of wall. Easily identifiable by the dirty great piton sticking out below the centre of the main headwall (unless some hero removes said piton of course). Route 1 Diff On left side of Upper Tier there is an obvious short corner at the top of the wall. Climb easily to the corner and a stiffer finish Route 2 V Diff Between R1 and PZZ is a groove that forks at half height. Climb the LHS of the groove and the L fork. Hard to protect Route 3 V Diff The RHS and right fork of the groove. Well protected with a bit of a pull to finish p. z. z 6m S On left side of Upper Tier, take line trending slightly rightwards, finishing along a very thin crack."

It is not often possible to traverse the cave at this point to the next feature, Devil's Kitchen and the Northern Area. All climbs are therefore described from the descents to this section. ==North Section== Travel 250 feet along and up the ridge from the cairns to where the wall-cum-fence ends. Cross the wall and locate an 80 ft. moderate slab descent. Alternatively scramble down the ridge on the right (facing out) to a stake. Descend by reverse mantleshelves to easy slabs at the foot of the cliff. The first route, moving right, is a cracked slabby wall. LIMERICK LADDER 100ft Diff Climb the cracked wall, pleasantly, to a steep finish. DOCTOR'S CHOICE 110ft V.Diff Start: To the right is a shallow chimney 1. 70 ft Ascend to a corner just inside the ridge. Climb this and grooves above to stance. 2. 40 ft Climb the wall to the ridge and finish either direct or move right to an easy corner to finish. WHITE WALL ** 120ft V.Diff Start: Move around a corner right of Doctor's Choice to a narrow slab. 1. 60 ft Climb the slab and a short chimney to a ledge. Move up to larger ledge and stance below a white wall. 2. 60 ft Ascend the wall direct on large holds to a rising traverse to the right, to finish at a short corner. DEVIL'S KITCHEN ** 120ft Diff Start: The main feature of this area is an unpleasant looking amphitheatre. The ascent of which is this climb. 1. 30 ft Scramble up easy slabs to a pool. 2. 40 ft Climb across the right wall to a stance and piton belay in the corner. 3. 50 ft Climb to the right and ascend slabby corner to the top. WHITE WALL CORNER 90ft HS Start: From the pool on Devil's Kitchen on the left wall. 1. 40 ft From the pool ascend the wall direct to a stance below a steep corner right of White Wall. 2. 55 ft Ascend the corner direct. DEVIL'S GROOVES 95ft HS Start: As for White Wall Corner. At 30 ft move right into shallow grooves on the left wall of Devil's Kitchen. Ascend direct to a steep finish. ==Stuckanboy== This is the spectacular pinnacle halfway along the coast between Tracrua and Cooseenaceol. The landward connection of the pinnacle is reached by abseil. ORIGINAL ROUTE 70ft HS Traverse across ledges to the south side and the wide crack/cleft to the narrow summit. Descend by a contrived abseil. A very serious venture. ==The Lug Area== The best climbing here is in the gorge nearest Horse Shoe Bay. Descend down a black chimney or approach from the sea. There are three routes on the east side, severe, very difficult and difficult and one route on the west side, 55 ft severe. On the western section of the Lug there is a good 60 ft corner, severe grade, 150 ft along a sea level traverse from the sea and three other less worthy routes. ==Coosacoam== This is a short but very good value training crag with seven climbs on the east side, ranging from difficult to severe. On the west side the obvious crack is very difficult. The central ribs on the east side at mild severe is the best climb here. This crag can be approached by crossing the ridge above the island's water supply tanks descending a prominent gully to the crag at sea level. I'm not sure if these are new routes or not, but couldn't elucidate them from the existing guide so I thought I'd hand it over to the local experts. We climbed 2 routes on 18th August on what I believe is the Cooseenaceol area of Sherkin Island on what is referred to as the 'South Section'. Both routes start up the crack line below the arete which is approximately 1/3 of the way along the main wall from the right hand side. Route 1 breaks off left and follows the curving corner crack to the top before exiting to the right (similar to the described existing route 'Reserve'). Consensus of the party was VS 4c. Route 2 follows the crack line immediately right of the arete and follows this directly to the top. Split opinion left us between VS 4c and HVS 5a. Both routes were led by myself and seconded by Craig Woods and Tom Matthews. If new we came up with the names 1. Waiting for the Sun 2. Bangor Beta. I would be interested to know if these routes have been climbed before. Find attached a photograph topo with the routes marked. If you would like to publish the photo to the web page I can provide an unedited or higher resolution file. All the best, Neil Mullinger"

There is further potential on the slabs to the west of these routes. The Flake Slab West of the two slabs mentioned already is this tall slab recessed into a square-cut bay. The rock is strange and brittle, but workable. It is an uptilted surface of fossil wave ripples. The slabby nature of the routes means you should never need to pull too hard, which is good as pulling hard on this rock isn't highly recommended. The bottom of the crag is reached by abseil and all routes bar 1 and 2 are tidal."
