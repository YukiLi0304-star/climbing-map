Bridge up this to the top and move left via a good hold on the arête and up to a ledge, a spike runner and large friend placements. Bold climbing leads up and left to a series of blind grooves (good nut runner at a jammed block in the chimney bounding the buttress on the left). These are followed until it is possible to step left and down to a huge belay platform. A committing pitch.\n2) 25m (6b). Climb the thin crack to an excellent runner placement level with a narrow overlap on the right. Traverse right just under this to a crack. When this closes, make some hard moves to gain a series of narrow ledges leading to a break in the left side of the long roof. The sustained groove is followed by some thin cracks, which are climbed until a break left. Follow this break to a groove which leads easily to the top."
