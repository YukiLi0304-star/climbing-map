Ascend directly to the top. Crater 10m VS 4c Start at the toe of the buttress or the crack just to the right. Climb the wall to the top. Right of the last route the crag is broken by a grassy ledge at 3m which has a collection of pinnacles at it's right end. Ivy Tower 10m VS 5a Start at a recess below the left end of the ledge and scramble up to it. Move right to the cleft at the back of the first pinnacle. Climb the cleft, with difficulty initially, to gain the top of the pinnacle. Step across the gap into a groove and up this to the top. Siamese Chimneys 8m Moderate There are a set of chimneys splitting the pinnacles. Immediately below these is a small buttress. Climb this into the chimney and move right onto a slab on the second pinnacle. Up this to the top. Right of the pinnacles the crag fades into the hillside - 5m to the right is an isolated buttress split by a groove which diminishes to an overhanging crack in its upper part Hanging Gardens 8m Severe Climb the groove and overhanging crack. Beware of loose rock in the lower section. Other Information: A low level traverse has been done on the main crag at about 5c/6a.&nbsp;Other isolated outcrops on the hill provide limited opportunities for bouldering. One of the best of these is a smooth 4m high buttress above and right of the leftmost of the string of broken buttresses seen slanting across the hill from right to left when&nbsp;approaching the main crag. This buttress has an undercut crack at 4c and a leaning corner at 5a."
