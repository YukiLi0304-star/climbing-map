There is another route starting in a separate crack system just to the right of Cockle. This route was climbed on the same day as Cockle but was never recorded for some reason. Well worth doing. Climb the crack easily to the base of an obvious flake. Ascend the flake to top. V.Diff. Scallop** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4b) A narrow chimney separates the left side of the Pulpit from the slabs. A thin, intermittent crack starts near the base of the chimney and runs up the steep slab to a little notch at the top. This is the line of Scallop. Climb down the steep left-hand side of the Pulpit and move into the base of the short chimney. Gain the crack and climb it. Protection adequate, though it needs careful placement. At full tide, or when heavy seas are running, the crack can be reached by a delicate traverse left from the Pulpit platform. SCALLOP HS 4b The Gangplank&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M The easy angled crack in the groove above the Pulpit. Either back-climb it or abseil down it to reach the Pulpit. OYSTER. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S ) Start from the Pulpit. Climb diagonally right up the black slab to the right of The Gangplank to a horizontal crack. Make a delicate step across right to a small spike and follow the thin crack on small holds. LOBSTER &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4a) Start from the Pulpit. Move across right to the foot of a narrow slab with an overlap and thin crack on it's left. Climb the narrow slab until it is possible to step across right (crossing the line of Puffin) onto the main slab, below a flake-crack sloping up right. Layback the flake to the top. PUFFIN* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4b) Scramble down the right-hand side of the Pulpit, and step right into a groove. Climb this to the base of the deep crack. Climb the crack, moving left into a groove near the top. Large hexes or friends useful. RULE THE WAVES.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4b) Scramble down the right-hand side of the Pulpit and move right across the groove to the foot of the steep, dimpled slab. Climb this, trending slightly right near the top. Sparse Protection. Carraigeen* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4b) About 8m right of the Pulpit a narrow chimney runs straight up the slab from the sea. This is the line of Barnacle, and the climb starts from it's base. Start from a nut belay at the base of the chimney, reached by abseil. The belay point varies with the state of the tide. Climb diagonally left across the slab to gain a crack which runs up diagonally left. Follow the crack to finish up via the flake as for the finish of Lobster. Thoughts from the Glans. 12m S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4a) Start as for Carrageen. Climb up the grey slab a little left of the chimney, on rounded holds, to reach left-trending crack. Pass the left side of a bulge and climb direct to the top on good jugs. Barnacle* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VD Start As for Carrageen. Climb the chimney . ARE YOU WITH ME** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HVS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5a) Start As for Carrageen. Step out right and climb onto small overhanging block. Make a bold move out right and mantelshelf up onto ledge (crux). Good flake hold about 1.5m right of the overhanging block. Climb left-trending crack to top on good holds (small wires useful for protection). Hornblower's Crack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4c) Start about 4m right of Barnacle chimney, on a short ramp just above the high tide mark. Climb slightly left into recessed crack, which is left trending (crux). Follow the obvious line to the top. Crab. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D Useful for starting Mammary Gland. 5m right of Barnacle there is an easy angled chimney with a steep undercut base, this is the line of Crab. Abseil down to a nut belay in the base of the chimney. Climb the chimney. Mammary Gland &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HVS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5a) Low tide only. After a difficult start it joins Thunderbolt at half-height. Start As for Crab, at the very bottom of the chimney. Make a difficult traverse right from the base of Crab to a small ledge. Climb right up the crack above, tricky to start with, but easing with height. ====Bracket Slabs==== For Bracket Slabs, you need to locate the boulders, with several pitons in situ (check their condition before using them), two meters in from the edge of the cliff and opposite the obvious brackets jutting out from just below the top of the cliff. An abseil of 25 meters from the edge of the cliff, down between the two brackets, following the obvious groove of Cricklewood, will land you on The Slipway. Unless you are leaving the rope in situ you will need to extend the anchor point to the edge of the slab, otherwise the rope may not pull down. NOTE: The easiest line back up from here is Cricklewood, at mild severe (harder in wet conditions). From the base of Cricklewood a sloping shelf - The Slipway - runs down along the foot of the slabs to the sea-floor. Immediately left of Cricklewood is a fine lichen-spotted slab, with a thin crack running up it's right-hand side to an overhang: this is Spinnaker. Left of Spinnaker a narrow, bow-shaped slab gives the line of Camán, and immediately left of this is a constricted chimney - Tough Soot. The corners down to the left of this have been climbed, but in recent years they have become very vegetated on the upper section, due to soil slippage, and are no longer feasible. At the foot of the Slipway is Black-Bottom, a large, black, undercut slab with a crack running across it's lower section and an overhang on the top left. Thunderbolt VD Low tide only. Start in the corner below and left of the bottom of the Slipway, to the left of Black-Bottom slab. Climb up to reach the right end of a horizontal crack. Move out along this and up to a second crack. Continue easily to the top. The Slipway. bb - Blackbottom VS. A - Toughsoot HVS. B - Camán HS. C - Spinnaker VS. D - Cricklewood MS. Black-bottom &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4c) Low tide only. (poor protection). Start by scrambling carefully down to reach an oblong, seaweed-covered block at the bottom of the Slipway. Step off the block onto the slab and move left to a niche at the foot of the vertical crack. Climb the crack until it fades out below the overhang. Make a couple of difficult moves right to gain good holds and climb diagonally right to the top of the slab. Pull up over the overhanging corner and follow the groove up left to a belay. Tough Soot &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HVS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5a, 4c) Low to half-tide Start from the Slipway, at the foot of a narrow chimney, just left of Camán. 1. 18m Climb the chimney and the corner above to a block belay just below the left edge of The Crow's Nest. 2. 10m (delicate and unprotected originally, this pitch has recently been equipped with pitons). Climb the green slab above, starting at the bottom right and finishing on the top left or, if preferred, climb the 2nd pitch of Camán). Camán. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4b, 4a) Note This climb has recently, and unnecessarily, been equipped with numerous pitons. How long they will last in the salt-laden atmosphere remains to be seen. Start from the Slipway, at the foot of a narrow, curving slab with a deep crack in the overlap on its right. 1. 18m Climb the slab (a runner on the curve of the crack will prevent the rope from becoming jammed in the crack) and the corner above, to a block belay below the Crow's Nest, as for Tough Soot. 2 10m Climb the thin crack just left of the first bracket. Spinnaker* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4c, 4a) Start from the Slipway, 3m left of Cricklewood, at the bottom right of the slab. 1. 18m Climb the shallow crack (small wires) on small holds to reach a good hold 2m below the overhang. Make a difficult move up (crux) to gain a good crack beneath the overhang. Step out right move up and over the blocks to the Crows Nest. 2. 10m As for the second pitch of Camán. Cricklewood** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4a) The first route put up in this area, and probably the most frequently climbed line hereabouts. Start On the Slipway, below the obvious long groove. Climb the groove, which is difficult to start, to the Crow's Nest (possible belay, advisable during stormy weather, when communication is difficult), and continue up the shallow corner between the two brackets. Cricklewood S (line of abseil access) Razorbill &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4a) The initial slab is delicate, particularly when wet. Start just right of Cricklewood, below a narrow slab, with a thin crack on its right. Climb the slab near its left edge (delicate) and the rib on the edge of Cricklewood until an obvious traverse line leads left into that climb. Finish as for Cricklewood. ====Telegraph Slab==== Right of Bracket Slab and away from the sea. The telegraph pole on the left in the topo gave the name to Telegraph Slab but it was badly burnt in a gorse fire a few years back and cut down (the wires now run along the railway line through the tunnel). We used to ab down the slab from the pole, when going down to the foot of Bracket Slabs, so the slab got a fair bit of traffic and we kept the routes fairly clean, but they are all vegetated now and have been included just for the record. The whole area where the pole was has become covered in gorse but you might find one of the steel braces for the pole among the furze bushes and ab from that. Now the preferred approach is to ab down the line of Cricklewood from 3 insitu pegs. The line of Twilight is now buried beneath huge piles of boulders, put there to prevent coastal erosion. ====Streaky Slab==== Home to some of the earliest climbs in the country. Access. Coming from Bray, follow the Cliff Path to a point a few metres short of where it rises to meet a short flight of steps, 20 minutes, (coming from the other direction, this is the flight of steps you descend, 10 minutes). Cross the fence and follow traces of a narrow path leftwards towards a patch of scree. Go down over this to a path fronting a bank. Shaft is reached by turning left here, but for Streaky Slab turn right and follow the path, with care, for about 50m, to a little rocky notch above some steps leading down to a boulder field. Cross this to the bottom of the slab. The first three climbs were originally started by traversing in above the sea from a concrete platform to the right of the slab, but the platform has been demolished and the sea pushed back by the dumping of large boulders here in an attempt to protect the railway line from coastal erosion. Airy Edge*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VD Well named. Start from the boulders below the left edge. Climb up to a saddle below the edge. Follow the edge, keeping to the face of the slab. Fat Crack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M Start below the wide crack. Climb up to the crack and follow it to the top. Jack Spratt. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4b) Delightful, delicate, but unprotected slab climbing; a more serious proposition nowadays, as a fall would land you on the boulders, rather than in the sea. Start below a thin, shallow, intermittent crack running up near the centre of the slab. Climb the crack to a narrow sloping ledge just below half-height. A couple of thin moves lead to better holds and the horizontal section of Fat Crack. Finish direct. LEAN CRACK* 14m VD Pleasant climbing on small holds, with good protection. Start 2m in from the right edge, below the obvious crack. Some difficult moves lead to better holds, step left near the top to finish up the crack. ) The next climb lies a little to the north of Streaky Slab and is approached by turning left after descending to the bank mentioned above. Follow the narrow path carefully north to the cave-like mouth of the adit. The rock here is quartzite, the protection excellent, and the climb worth making the short detour for. Shaft** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4b) Start at the entrance to the adit. Climb up on the right and step left onto the roof of the adit. Follow the crack into the corner and step right to climb the rib leading to some blocks below the start of the deep, clean crack running up left. Follow this up over a bulge. Move slightly right and up to belay on a large block. Shaft VS4b ==Inland Climbs== ====Ballynamuddagh South==== The approach follows a carriageway constructed by Lord Meath over a hundred years ago, to allow visitors staying at his nearby mansion, Killruddery House, enjoy the wide-ranging views from the Head without having to put a foot to the ground. Happily, pedestrian use of the carriageway has always been allowed. All-in-all, a pleasant spot for an easy day, a sunny winter's morning or a summer evening, and only a twenty minute stroll from the car park or bus-stop. View of buttress from the track. APPROACH. Leave the N11 at junction 7, (the one north of Kilmacanoge) and follow the signposts for Greystones to reach the R761, the road leading directly from Bray to Greystones. Drive up the hill towards Greystones, passing the entrance to Bray Golf Club, and take the first turn on the left. This turn is directly opposite a Dublin Bus shelter on the far side of the road. (For those travelling by bus (no.84) alight at Windgates, 5 meters from here). Drive a short distance down this cul-de-sac to park at the far end of a low stone wall on the right, near the foot of a lane (the original carriageway). Approaching from this direction the buttress we are heading for is the nearest and highest of the Ballynamuddagh buttresses, yet, conversely, it is the last of the three to come into view. It lies only a few meters below the track, directly under one of the few remaining sections of the old boundary wall and directly above a small beach covered in boulder armour. The crag is tucked into a steep, bracken-covered slope and it is possible, with care, to scramble down near the northern edge, to access the foot of the crag (look for traces of a path going down by the two small, dead trees). Or you can, if you choose, use one of several abseil points I equipped while cleaning, but note that each of these points can, and should, be backed up with an additional thread, hex or nut. A 50m rope, doubled, will get you to the foot of the climbs and as an added precaution, if you do decide to abseil in, it makes sense to gear up just below the wall, before moving down to the ab point. Note: while several of the easier climbs can be well protected and may be suitable for those learning to lead, the centre of the face is steep, with small holds, and spaced protection, requiring steadiness. The climbs are described from Left to Right while facing the crag. The first four routes start from the same belay point - at a little furze bush at the bottom of the left edge of the crag. I. Leo. Diff. Climb the Left edge, step across L and follow a crack to belay in a little niche. H.Herzmann, G.Moss. 4/12/13."

            "description": "====Bracket Slabs==== For Bracket Slabs, you need to locate the boulders, with several pitons in situ (check their condition before using them), two meters in from the edge of the cliff and opposite the obvious brackets jutting out from just below the top of the cliff. An abseil of 25 meters from the edge of the cliff, down between the two brackets, following the obvious groove of Cricklewood, will land you on The Slipway. Unless you are leaving the rope in situ you will need to extend the anchor point to the edge of the slab, otherwise the rope may not pull down. NOTE: The easiest line back up from here is Cricklewood, at mild severe (harder in wet conditions). From the base of Cricklewood a sloping shelf - The Slipway - runs down along the foot of the slabs to the sea-floor. Immediately left of Cricklewood is a fine lichen-spotted slab, with a thin crack running up it's right-hand side to an overhang: this is Spinnaker. Left of Spinnaker a narrow, bow-shaped slab gives the line of Camán, and immediately left of this is a constricted chimney - Tough Soot. The corners down to the left of this have been climbed, but in recent years they have become very vegetated on the upper section, due to soil slippage, and are no longer feasible. At the foot of the Slipway is Black-Bottom, a large, black, undercut slab with a crack running across it's lower section and an overhang on the top left. Thunderbolt VD Low tide only. Start in the corner below and left of the bottom of the Slipway, to the left of Black-Bottom slab. Climb up to reach the right end of a horizontal crack. Move out along this and up to a second crack. Continue easily to the top. The Slipway. bb - Blackbottom VS. A - Toughsoot HVS. B - Camán HS. C - Spinnaker VS. D - Cricklewood MS. Black-bottom &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4c) Low tide only. (poor protection). Start by scrambling carefully down to reach an oblong, seaweed-covered block at the bottom of the Slipway. Step off the block onto the slab and move left to a niche at the foot of the vertical crack. Climb the crack until it fades out below the overhang. Make a couple of difficult moves right to gain good holds and climb diagonally right to the top of the slab. Pull up over the overhanging corner and follow the groove up left to a belay. Tough Soot &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HVS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5a, 4c) Low to half-tide Start from the Slipway, at the foot of a narrow chimney, just left of Camán. 1. 18m Climb the chimney and the corner above to a block belay just below the left edge of The Crow's Nest. 2. 10m (delicate and unprotected originally, this pitch has recently been equipped with pitons).

Camán. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4b, 4a) Note This climb has recently, and unnecessarily, been equipped with numerous pitons. How long they will last in the salt-laden atmosphere remains to be seen. Start from the Slipway, at the foot of a narrow, curving slab with a deep crack in the overlap on its right. 1. 18m Climb the slab (a runner on the curve of the crack will prevent the rope from becoming jammed in the crack) and the corner above, to a block belay below the Crow's Nest, as for Tough Soot. 2 10m Climb the thin crack just left of the first bracket. Spinnaker* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4c, 4a) Start from the Slipway, 3m left of Cricklewood, at the bottom right of the slab. 1. 18m Climb the shallow crack (small wires) on small holds to reach a good hold 2m below the overhang. Make a difficult move up (crux) to gain a good crack beneath the overhang. Step out right move up and over the blocks to the Crows Nest. 2. 10m As for the second pitch of Camán. Cricklewood** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4a) The first route put up in this area, and probably the most frequently climbed line hereabouts. Start On the Slipway, below the obvious long groove. Climb the groove, which is difficult to start, to the Crow's Nest (possible belay, advisable during stormy weather, when communication is difficult), and continue up the shallow corner between the two brackets. Cricklewood S (line of abseil access) Razorbill &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4a) The initial slab is delicate, particularly when wet. Start just right of Cricklewood, below a narrow slab, with a thin crack on its right. Climb the slab near its left edge (delicate) and the rib on the edge of Cricklewood until an obvious traverse line leads left into that climb. Finish as for Cricklewood. ====Telegraph Slab==== Right of Bracket Slab and away from the sea. The telegraph pole on the left in the topo gave the name to Telegraph Slab but it was badly burnt in a gorse fire a few years back and cut down (the wires now run along the railway line through the tunnel). We used to ab down the slab from the pole, when going down to the foot of Bracket Slabs, so the slab got a fair bit of traffic and we kept the routes fairly clean, but they are all vegetated now and have been included just for the record. The whole area where the pole was has become covered in gorse but you might find one of the steel braces for the pole among the furze bushes and ab from that. Now the preferred approach is to ab down the line of Cricklewood from 3 insitu pegs. The line of Twilight is now buried beneath huge piles of boulders, put there to prevent coastal erosion. ====Streaky Slab==== Home to some of the earliest climbs in the country. Access. Coming from Bray, follow the Cliff Path to a point a few metres short of where it rises to meet a short flight of steps, 20 minutes, (coming from the other direction, this is the flight of steps you descend, 10 minutes). Cross the fence and follow traces of a narrow path leftwards towards a patch of scree. Go down over this to a path fronting a bank. Shaft is reached by turning left here, but for Streaky Slab turn right and follow the path, with care, for about 50m, to a little rocky notch above some steps leading down to a boulder field. Cross this to the bottom of the slab. The first three climbs were originally started by traversing in above the sea from a concrete platform to the right of the slab, but the platform has been demolished and the sea pushed back by the dumping of large boulders here in an attempt to protect the railway line from coastal erosion. Airy Edge*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VD Well named. Start from the boulders below the left edge. Climb up to a saddle below the edge. Follow the edge, keeping to the face of the slab. Fat Crack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M Start below the wide crack. Climb up to the crack and follow it to the top. Jack Spratt. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4b) Delightful, delicate, but unprotected slab climbing; a more serious proposition nowadays, as a fall would land you on the boulders, rather than in the sea. Start below a thin, shallow, intermittent crack running up near the centre of the slab. Climb the crack to a narrow sloping ledge just below half-height. A couple of thin moves lead to better holds and the horizontal section of Fat Crack. Finish direct. LEAN CRACK* 14m VD Pleasant climbing on small holds, with good protection. Start 2m in from the right edge, below the obvious crack. Some difficult moves lead to better holds, step left near the top to finish up the crack. ) The next climb lies a little to the north of Streaky Slab and is approached by turning left after descending to the bank mentioned above. Follow the narrow path carefully north to the cave-like mouth of the adit. The rock here is quartzite, the protection excellent, and the climb worth making the short detour for. Shaft** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4b) Start at the entrance to the adit. Climb up on the right and step left onto the roof of the adit. Follow the crack into the corner and step right to climb the rib leading to some blocks below the start of the deep, clean crack running up left. Follow this up over a bulge. Move slightly right and up to belay on a large block. Shaft VS4b ==Inland Climbs== ====Ballynamuddagh South==== The approach follows a carriageway constructed by Lord Meath over a hundred years ago, to allow visitors staying at his nearby mansion, Killruddery House, enjoy the wide-ranging views from the Head without having to put a foot to the ground. Happily, pedestrian use of the carriageway has always been allowed. All-in-all, a pleasant spot for an easy day, a sunny winter's morning or a summer evening, and only a twenty minute stroll from the car park or bus-stop. View of buttress from the track. APPROACH. Leave the N11 at junction 7, (the one north of Kilmacanoge) and follow the signposts for Greystones to reach the R761, the road leading directly from Bray to Greystones. Drive up the hill towards Greystones, passing the entrance to Bray Golf Club, and take the first turn on the left. This turn is directly opposite a Dublin Bus shelter on the far side of the road. (For those travelling by bus (no.84) alight at Windgates, 5 meters from here). Drive a short distance down this cul-de-sac to park at the far end of a low stone wall on the right, near the foot of a lane (the original carriageway). Approaching from this direction the buttress we are heading for is the nearest and highest of the Ballynamuddagh buttresses, yet, conversely, it is the last of the three to come into view. It lies only a few meters below the track, directly under one of the few remaining sections of the old boundary wall and directly above a small beach covered in boulder armour. The crag is tucked into a steep, bracken-covered slope and it is possible, with care, to scramble down near the northern edge, to access the foot of the crag (look for traces of a path going down by the two small, dead trees). Or you can, if you choose, use one of several abseil points I equipped while cleaning, but note that each of these points can, and should, be backed up with an additional thread, hex or nut.

A couple of thin moves lead to better holds and the horizontal section of Fat Crack. Finish direct. LEAN CRACK* 14m VD Pleasant climbing on small holds, with good protection. Start 2m in from the right edge, below the obvious crack. Some difficult moves lead to better holds, step left near the top to finish up the crack. ) The next climb lies a little to the north of Streaky Slab and is approached by turning left after descending to the bank mentioned above. Follow the narrow path carefully north to the cave-like mouth of the adit. The rock here is quartzite, the protection excellent, and the climb worth making the short detour for. Shaft** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4b) Start at the entrance to the adit. Climb up on the right and step left onto the roof of the adit.

Move slightly right and up to belay on a large block. Shaft VS4b ==Inland Climbs== ====Ballynamuddagh South==== The approach follows a carriageway constructed by Lord Meath over a hundred years ago, to allow visitors staying at his nearby mansion, Killruddery House, enjoy the wide-ranging views from the Head without having to put a foot to the ground. Happily, pedestrian use of the carriageway has always been allowed. All-in-all, a pleasant spot for an easy day, a sunny winter's morning or a summer evening, and only a twenty minute stroll from the car park or bus-stop. View of buttress from the track. APPROACH. Leave the N11 at junction 7, (the one north of Kilmacanoge) and follow the signposts for Greystones to reach the R761, the road leading directly from Bray to Greystones. Drive up the hill towards Greystones, passing the entrance to Bray Golf Club, and take the first turn on the left. This turn is directly opposite a Dublin Bus shelter on the far side of the road. (For those travelling by bus (no.84) alight at Windgates, 5 meters from here). Drive a short distance down this cul-de-sac to park at the far end of a low stone wall on the right, near the foot of a lane (the original carriageway). Approaching from this direction the buttress we are heading for is the nearest and highest of the Ballynamuddagh buttresses, yet, conversely, it is the last of the three to come into view. It lies only a few meters below the track, directly under one of the few remaining sections of the old boundary wall and directly above a small beach covered in boulder armour. The crag is tucked into a steep, bracken-covered slope and it is possible, with care, to scramble down near the northern edge, to access the foot of the crag (look for traces of a path going down by the two small, dead trees). Or you can, if you choose, use one of several abseil points I equipped while cleaning, but note that each of these points can, and should, be backed up with an additional thread, hex or nut. A 50m rope, doubled, will get you to the foot of the climbs and as an added precaution, if you do decide to abseil in, it makes sense to gear up just below the wall, before moving down to the ab point. Note: while several of the easier climbs can be well protected and may be suitable for those learning to lead, the centre of the face is steep, with small holds, and spaced protection, requiring steadiness. The climbs are described from Left to Right while facing the crag. The first four routes start from the same belay point - at a little furze bush at the bottom of the left edge of the crag. I. Leo. Diff. Climb the Left edge, step across L and follow a crack to belay in a little niche. H.Herzmann, G.Moss. 4/12/13."

Cricklewood** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4a) The first route put up in this area, and probably the most frequently climbed line hereabouts. Start On the Slipway, below the obvious long groove. Climb the groove, which is difficult to start, to the Crow's Nest (possible belay, advisable during stormy weather, when communication is difficult), and continue up the shallow corner between the two brackets. Cricklewood S (line of abseil access) Razorbill &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4a) The initial slab is delicate, particularly when wet. Start just right of Cricklewood, below a narrow slab, with a thin crack on its right. Climb the slab near its left edge (delicate) and the rib on the edge of Cricklewood until an obvious traverse line leads left into that climb. Finish as for Cricklewood. ====Telegraph Slab==== Right of Bracket Slab and away from the sea. The telegraph pole on the left in the topo gave the name to Telegraph Slab but it was badly burnt in a gorse fire a few years back and cut down (the wires now run along the railway line through the tunnel). We used to ab down the slab from the pole, when going down to the foot of Bracket Slabs, so the slab got a fair bit of traffic and we kept the routes fairly clean, but they are all vegetated now and have been included just for the record. The whole area where the pole was has become covered in gorse but you might find one of the steel braces for the pole among the furze bushes and ab from that. Now the preferred approach is to ab down the line of Cricklewood from 3 insitu pegs. The line of Twilight is now buried beneath huge piles of boulders, put there to prevent coastal erosion. ====Streaky Slab==== Home to some of the earliest climbs in the country. Access. Coming from Bray, follow the Cliff Path to a point a few metres short of where it rises to meet a short flight of steps, 20 minutes, (coming from the other direction, this is the flight of steps you descend, 10 minutes). Cross the fence and follow traces of a narrow path leftwards towards a patch of scree. Go down over this to a path fronting a bank. Shaft is reached by turning left here, but for Streaky Slab turn right and follow the path, with care, for about 50m, to a little rocky notch above some steps leading down to a boulder field. Cross this to the bottom of the slab. The first three climbs were originally started by traversing in above the sea from a concrete platform to the right of the slab, but the platform has been demolished and the sea pushed back by the dumping of large boulders here in an attempt to protect the railway line from coastal erosion. Airy Edge*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VD Well named. Start from the boulders below the left edge. Climb up to a saddle below the edge.

From the base of Cricklewood a sloping shelf - The Slipway - runs down along the foot of the slabs to the sea-floor. Immediately left of Cricklewood is a fine lichen-spotted slab, with a thin crack running up it's right-hand side to an overhang: this is Spinnaker. Left of Spinnaker a narrow, bow-shaped slab gives the line of Camán, and immediately left of this is a constricted chimney - Tough Soot. The corners down to the left of this have been climbed, but in recent years they have become very vegetated on the upper section, due to soil slippage, and are no longer feasible. At the foot of the Slipway is Black-Bottom, a large, black, undercut slab with a crack running across it's lower section and an overhang on the top left. Thunderbolt VD Low tide only.

SUN LOUNGING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HS(4b) Start 3m right of Warming Up at a short groove. Climb this past a pocket to a ledge left of furze; directly up the short wall behind to finish. RUNNING BEFORE THE WIND. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HS. Start just right of the previous route, at a shallow groove. Climb the groove on small holds to the ledge right of the furze. Finish up the short cracked wall above the tree. The difficulties are short but poorly protected. Moving around to the right, there is a crack and groove above a spike at the left-hand edge of the overhanging face. KNUCKLEBALL*** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E2(5c). Start directly below the crack splitting the roof at it's widest point. Stepping off the boulder, make a move to gain the cosy nook shared by NRG. From the perch find excellent gear and then commit to the roof crack, topping out onto good holds where the crack continues. NRG* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E2(5b/5c). Start to the left of the deep, wide chimney, at a shallow groove. Climb the groove and the right-hand crack in the overhang above; strenuous but well protected. SORCHAS. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VS(4b). Bridge up the chimney between its right-hand edge and the left wall, passing outside the chockstone. Overcoming the narrows provides an airy crux. Sorchas VS 4b DORCHAS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D Start as for Sorchas. Move up the floor of the chimney to a step halfway along. Bridge up to finish behind the chockstone. CARRICK CRACK* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VS(4c). Start at the right-hand edge of the steep, narrow wall, just left of another broad chimney, below a crack. Make a difficult move to gain a sloping ledge. Climb the crack above which is strenuous, but well protected. DOUBLE DECKER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HS(4b) Bridge up the flared walls of the chimney CARRICK ON CLIMBING. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VD Start just right of the chimney, at the foot of a short, right trending ramp. Climb the ramp and finish up the cracked wall and the ledges above. GENTLE AIRS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HS(4b) Climb the front edge of the large spike with a delicate finish. Continue up the easy broad arête. ON THE RUN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HS(4b) Start at a deep recess to the right of the spike. Climb the flake crack on the left with a strenuous pull onto the ledge. Move right onto a short slab and up this past a break to upper slab, working slightly right to finishing bulge. COCOONING WHORTS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HS The corner between On The Run and Garvaghy Road. Climb the corner moving left around the overhang with some deft footwork (crux). Move right to gain the arete and climb the wall above on good holds. GARVAGHY ROAD. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VS(4c) Start behind the holly tree, below a narrow jammed flake at 2m. Move up to a ledge and gain the top of the flake. Difficult moves off the flake provide the crux. Garvaghy Road VS4c QUEEN'S HIGHWAY. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E1(5b) Start 2m right of Garvaghy Road, below the left edge of the 20m slab. Climb a bulge to the foot of the slab and follow an incipient crack line 1m left of the grass-filled crack. Thin moves, poorly protected, lead to a good finish. GLORIOUS TWELFTH. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VS(4c) Start 2m right of Queens Highway. Climb a bulge moving right to a ledge and good nut placement below the centre of the slab. Climb straight up, at first with difficulty and then more easily, to the top. APPRENTICE BOYS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S(4a) Start at a block, a few metres right of Glorious Twelfth. Good in-cut holds lead to a small bracket. Gain this (crux) and continue pleasantly to the top. ====Carrick Mountain - Aghowle Upper (2)==== The climbs are all in the lower grades, on sound rock, with good protection (small to medium nuts and/or cams useful) and, with one exception, the anchors on top are rigged using nuts and/or cams. All of which might make this a good spot for introducing beginners to the craft of trad climbing: leading, placing protection and setting up anchors on top for belays. As an added bonus, the view of the Wicklow mountains from the top of the crag is the finest, from Croghan Kinsella on the Wicklow/Wexford border, to Lug and its satellites, to Tonlagee and Kippure and around to Djouce and the Sugarloaf. So hillwalkers could spend a pleasant interlude identifying the many summits on view. Go left at the T junction on the forest road and continue uphill to a complex junction (ca. 10 mins.) Continue straight ahead, with areas cleared of trees on both sides of the rising road. The crag can be seen to your left on a rocky boss (Carrigmurrely) west of the main ridge line of Carrick Mountain. Eventually growing trees will hide it; nothing is permanent in a forest. A radio mast comes into view ahead and a crossroads is reached shortly after. Turn left and follow this road to a turning circle at the road head. From the top left of the turning circle go down a short firebreak and follow a line of small cairns to the foot of the crag, which can seen behind a belt of mature trees. A half-hour’s pleasant walk from the car park."

Climb the overhang by moving horizontally left and then up on good holds and jams in a very exposed position. Step right and then continue, trending leftwards, up the face to the top. ====GLENMALURE NORTH CRAG / POLE ROCK==== The crag is on the northern side of Glenmalure (Ref. T073 941) approximately 4 km up the valley from Drumgoff. Leave the road just beyond a tree-enclosed house opposite cowsheds about 300m south east of the car-park at Baravore Ford; the scramble up over the boulder-strewn, bracken-infested slope takes about 30 minutes. It makes a lot of sense to visit this crag before the bracken rears its ugly head from about mid-June. After that date anyone going there without a machete risks becoming suicidal. The best approach might be a diagonal from the carpark at the ford. The buttress is more than 50m high but is broken at about mid-height by an offset terrace. Much of the face is subject to winter seepage which accounts for the black moss which somewhat disfigures the appearance of the crag from the climber's perspective. A few of the routes are quite dirty but in general the climbing is of an enjoyable if hardly inspirational nature with proficiency in steep slab work being the main skill required. The routes are described from left to right as one faces the buttress. An important reference point is the large holly tree at the bottom centre. The routes starting from the base of the buttress are first described and then those from the offset terrace above. Pole Rock got its name from a pole fixed there to support a ropeway to bring turf cut on the upper slopes into the valley below.

Finish up over the blocks above as for Bee-line HIDDEN AGENDA * 21m E1 (5b) This thin, eliminate-type climb takes a direct line up the face to the right of Daedalus and just left of a black mossy streak. Start about 1 - 2m right of Daedalus at a crack. Climb left of this crack to a horizontal break. Continue upwards with hard moves around a circular area of white rock. Pass blocks with care and also the larger block above. Protection is sparse; \"Friends\" will be needed. Download topos of the next 4 routes at Glenmalure North 2 EVENING STAR 22m HVS (5a) Start just a little to the right of Hidden Agenda and follow a direct line between two parallel black mossy streaks. CIÚNAS * 25m VS (4c) Follows a steep line just left of centre on the buttress. Start from about 4-5m left of the holly tree. Climb up to a short crack-line and to a horizontal crack and then slant up right to an overhang which is surmounted near its right side. Continue up the right-trending, juggy crack until another crack leads out left. Follow this to a smooth lichenous scoop. Move up this to below a steep bulge and climb this poorly protected section to finish on a grassy ledge. BLAST OFF 52m VS (4c,4a) In a very dirty state, it could hardly be climbed without prior cleaning. The first pitch is not well protected. Start just left of the holly tree near the centre of the buttress. 1. 27m Climb the steep slab on good holds to a small ledge beneath an overhang and move diagonally left along a short, open, greasy crack to the base of the wall. Climb the wall going up and right on small widely-spaced holds, following the rough line of a shallow vegetated groove to reach a wide, grassy ledge. Belay at the back of the ledge. 2, 25m Climb the slabs at the back of the ledge diagonally right via quartzy seams to reach the base of a crack at 8m and climb this up the centre of the face, finishing on small holds towards the top. Belay well back. Download topos of the next 3 routes at Glenmalure North 3 THE WILD WIND BLOWS * 25m VS (4b) Start behind the holly tree moving in from the left and follow a more or less direct line to the top, at first up the right side of the raised narrow section of slab to a vegetated ledge and then up a crack and slab directly to the top, finishing to the right of the crux of Ciúnas. NO LINGERING ** 25m HVS (5a) Start immediately right of the holly tree. Climb the slab to reach blocky rock to the left of the overhang. Traverse right beneath this for several metres to the base of an arête forming the left wall of the obvious chimney. Move up and gain the slab above on the left side of the exposed arête. Make delicate balance moves up along the arête towards easier ground and the finish. LEFTIESWELL * 27m S (4a) Start on the right side of the buttress, right of the holly tree, under and slightly left of the obvious chimney at half-height. 1. 18m Climb the slab, trending right to the base of the chimney. Climb the right wall of the chimney to a grassy terrace and belay. 2. 9m Crux pitch. Go straight up from the top of the chimney which narrows to a crack with two awkward moves. Belay well back. Download topos of the next 3 routes at Glenmalure North 4 Also download topos of the next 5 routes at Glenmalure North full ANTICYCLONE 25m HS (4b) Start just right of Leftieswell about 8m right of the holly tree and at a right-trending quartz crack. 1. 15m Follow the thin knobby quartz line up to the ledge, continue up left of loose blocks to another ledge and then go diagonally right to finish at the belay ledge. 2. 10m Climb out left and go up the slab to the Leftieswell chimney; finish up just right of the chimney via the slab. Struggle through furze to belay well back on the terrace. ALIENS WAITING ROOM * 22m E1 (5b) This eliminate type slab climb, which has an unprotected crux, starts 2m to the left of the Cyclone Corner crack below a steep narrow slab going up to the left side of an overhang with a holly tree. Climb the delicate slab (avoiding any recourse to the crack) working gradually left towards the top to a small pedestal foothold on the left side of the slab above a heather ledge. Edge back right and pull up on the rounded top edge of the slab to the break just left of the overhang. Continue up the easier slab to the left of the overhang to the terrace. CYCLONE CORNER 52m VS (4c,4a) Start at the bottom right of the buttress at a partly vegetated crack which runs up to an overhang with a holly tree. Nature is reclaiming this route. 1. 22m Climb the crack to the overhang. Move out slightly left onto the steep slab and around the overhang (crux) to a stance. Climb the corner above, which is awkward to start. Belay at the terrace. 2. 30m Start in the middle of the wall (just right of Stone Maiden) about 2m left of the obvious crack. Climb up on small edges passing a diagonal crack to just below a horizontal break. Move out left to a heathery stance. Move up and diagonally right along a crack for about 6m and gain a slabby edge. Follow this to the top The following two climbs start off the higher left-hand level of the offset grassy terrace. PROCTOR'S SLAB 23m S (3c) Gives a good finish to Leftieswell. From the top of Leftieswell climb the centre of the obvious slab on good hidden holds to the top. THE VALLEY WILD 23m HS (4a/b) Start at the right-hand end of the higher terrace at an area of light-coloured quartzy rock. Go up a short curving crack and the short horizontal joints above it to reach the base of a crack. Climb the smooth slab to the left of the crack (crux)to finish. The next four routes start off the lower right-hand grassy terrace. This terrace can be reached by scrambling up the right-hand side of the buttress. GRANISTER 16m S (4a) Start at the left side of the terrace below a dirty corner. Climb up just to the right of a right-trending quartzy crack, to the small overhang. Go straight up over the overhang and belay on a block. STONE MAIDEN 30m S (4a) Start just to the right of Granister. Surmount the slight bulge (thread runner above it), move right and climb up just left of the narrow chimney over short horizontal joints until just level with the top of Granister. Finish up the tiers of rock and vegetation to the right of the arête. SLEEP-WALKER 14m VD Takes the long crack 4m to the right of Stone Maiden which leads up into the narrow chimney on the left side of the small overhang. Bridge up the crack and chimney to the top. TOE THE LINE 15m VS (4b) Start just right of Sleep-Walker and climb up a small ledge and the smooth wall to beneath the right-hand side of the overhang. Up past the break and work out right for 2m on small footholds to gain a short wide crack. Up this to finish. ====GLENMALURE LE BUET==== Immediately above the car park on the Northern slope of the valley is a small sport crag with 4 completed lines. The rock is very compact granite/schist with no natural protection. 4 routes have been equipped. Location: 52°59'21.7\"N 6°24'26.5\"W https://goo.gl/maps/8ugvbBqTAEDQPNb46 From left to right facing the crag: - FROM THE RIVER 12m 6a+ - LE BUET 12m 6b+ - TO THE SEA 15m 6c+ - RIGHT OF RETURN 12m 7a ====BARAVORE VALLEY/ BENLEAGH==== (also known as Fraughan Rock Glen or The Three Valleys or Bolinaskea - Buaile na Sciatha ) is approached by crossing the ford/bridge on the Avonbeg at Baravore turning towards the hostel and after 100m heading up the obvious spur to the left of the old mine building. On reaching the forest road follow it in a generally southwest to west direction until the scree slopes on the right-hand side of the valley come into sight above the forest, more or less directly ahead. Follow a slightly descending section of the track to a sharp left-hand bend,marked on the left by a large boulder, and continue for 100m to the foot of the falling ground. Turn in to the right and skirt some scraggy trees to a moraine which leads up through the forest to steep grass and heather slopes. Above can be seen a prominent gully to the left of The Rock of Baravore -a vegetated wall of rock forming the rim of the valley. This is known to climbers as Great Gully and is reached from the car park in less than one hour. The setting is wild and impressive with some excellent climbing. The Gully is 250m higher than Glendalough crag and so is more prone to cold winds. It shows its magnificence best on a fine day while in dull weather it can provide preparation for the Alps. Unstable or loose blocks are possible, due to the thin, serrated nature of the ridge, and care should always be exercised. Active erosion in the higher reaches of the gully makes descent difficult and unpleasant, particularly in rock boots. An abseil chain has been placed at the top of Great Gully Route. If this is to your satisfaction it will just be possible to reach the gully floor by using two 50m ropes. The climbs are found on the right-hand side when facing up the Gully and are described from the bottom upwards. See the location of the crag at Routes 22 & 45 and location of crag Download topos of the crag at Page 251 FLEETING SUMMER 32m E1 (5b) This route starts at a toe of rock at the bottom right side of the gully, 2m to the right of the Great Gully Route corner. Gain the narrow slab delicately from the left and climb up to a small overhang which is taken on its front face. Move left and up the short grassy corner to a heather ledge beneath an undercut hanging groove. Gain the groove with difficulty and reach up to a horizontal break. Traverse out left onto the steep slab and climb up steeply to reach a narrow foot-ledge at the break. Continue up the centre of the slab and easier blocks beyond to gain a good thread and flake belay on the right side of the ridge. To escape, scramble down to the right. GREAT GULLY RIDGE ** 140m HS (4a,3c,4b,4a) This climb takes a line up the rock ridge which bounds the right-hand side of Great Gully; good clean climbing in a very fine situation. Best enjoyed with not more than 4 people on the route to savour the full flavour. Big groups take away from the experience and the tail-enders can expect to arrive home late. Start in the corner at the bottom right of the gully. (1) 10m Climb the corner to wide crack. Belay under a roof at the top of crack (2) 45m Gain the ridge and follow it directly to large stepping stones and easy ground. (3) 40m Move rightwards up steps and then climb a crack in the right corner of the slab above (crux) or more easily move up right via leaning corners and then back left above the crack. Gain height to a large platform visible from below. (4) 45m Move rightward to a short grassy wall. Move left up this for 3m to the base of a chimney with jammed blocks. Climb these to the top. Pitch not identified by anyone who sought it. It may describe going up via the off-width crack in the variation below. Variation: (4a) Climb a short grassy bank and step up left onto a wide ledge beneath an overhanging off width crack. Move on and down to the end of the ledge (belaying here reduces rope drag) and step up onto a small heathery ledge in a corner. Climb the corner to a ledge and continue up a cracked wall above it. Scramble across the face to a pointed detached block. Finish up the slope behind this. Overview Of Great Gully Ridge Photo: Nick Simons D-FOR-DOG* 18m VS (4b) Start just left of Great Gully corner at the bottom of the obvious clean slab. Climb the arête to the overhang and follow the parallel cracks to the ridge. FLAKE* 15m E1 (5b) Start 15m up on the right side of the gully. Climb broken rock to a grassy ledge beneath the triangular face. Follow the crack-line, trending leftwards to the sharp flake then move rightwards to finish at the boulder on the ridge. THE RAMP 15m VS (4b) Take the steep ramp to the left of the triangular face to the large overhang. Move right to finish. NOT Z BACKWARDS* 25m HVS (5b) Unknown first accent. LET THE HARE SIT 20m VS (4a/4b) From the top of the detached block this route takes the line via the short cracks above it (crux)then up easier ground on good holds to the half way mark. Veer up steeply right on large holds and good friction a meter or so in from the right edge to gain G.G.Ridge. THREE MAD SHEEP (Great Gully) 27m VS (High in the grade) Start on the right hand side of the giant rock pedestal, where the pedestal butts up to the face two meters right of Pauls Crack. Pitch one 22 meters VS. Start at the very wide crack almost like a chimney at the bottom. Climb this all the way as it closes in to form a crack, difficulty increases with height. Athletically finish lay back moves from rounded pulls. Belay on top of grass ledge from nut on face and large block on top of Gully Crack. Pitch two S 5 meters. Step out right and climb wall above on rounded but good friction holds, tending steeply to right. Good belay on ridge. PAUL'S CRACK 18m VS 4b Starts a further 20m up the gully. This route follows the obvious wide crack on the right side of the giant rock pedestal. Z BACKWARDS* 25m VS (4a/4b) Start under the left end of the overhang. Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

T073 941) approximately 4 km up the valley from Drumgoff. Leave the road just beyond a tree-enclosed house opposite cowsheds about 300m south east of the car-park at Baravore Ford; the scramble up over the boulder-strewn, bracken-infested slope takes about 30 minutes. It makes a lot of sense to visit this crag before the bracken rears its ugly head from about mid-June. After that date anyone going there without a machete risks becoming suicidal. The best approach might be a diagonal from the carpark at the ford. The buttress is more than 50m high but is broken at about mid-height by an offset terrace. Much of the face is subject to winter seepage which accounts for the black moss which somewhat disfigures the appearance of the crag from the climber's perspective. A few of the routes are quite dirty but in general the climbing is of an enjoyable if hardly inspirational nature with proficiency in steep slab work being the main skill required. The routes are described from left to right as one faces the buttress. An important reference point is the large holly tree at the bottom centre. The routes starting from the base of the buttress are first described and then those from the offset terrace above. Pole Rock got its name from a pole fixed there to support a ropeway to bring turf cut on the upper slopes into the valley below. Download topos of the crag at Page 245 Download topos of the next 4 routes at Glenmalure North 1 BEE LINE 17m VS (4c) Start to the left of the left edge of the main face and climb directly up between two faint crack-lines to two giant blocks, one above the other. Finish up over the blocks and belay a little to the right. DAEDALUS* 20m VS (4c) Start at the left side of the main face, below an arête. Climb the arête on its right side. The crux is a high step up to a smear at half-height. Finish up over the blocks above as for Bee-line HIDDEN AGENDA * 21m E1 (5b) This thin, eliminate-type climb takes a direct line up the face to the right of Daedalus and just left of a black mossy streak. Start about 1 - 2m right of Daedalus at a crack. Climb left of this crack to a horizontal break. Continue upwards with hard moves around a circular area of white rock. Pass blocks with care and also the larger block above. Protection is sparse; \"Friends\" will be needed. Download topos of the next 4 routes at Glenmalure North 2 EVENING STAR 22m HVS (5a) Start just a little to the right of Hidden Agenda and follow a direct line between two parallel black mossy streaks. CIÚNAS * 25m VS (4c) Follows a steep line just left of centre on the buttress. Start from about 4-5m left of the holly tree. Climb up to a short crack-line and to a horizontal crack and then slant up right to an overhang which is surmounted near its right side. Continue up the right-trending, juggy crack until another crack leads out left. Follow this to a smooth lichenous scoop. Move up this to below a steep bulge and climb this poorly protected section to finish on a grassy ledge. BLAST OFF 52m VS (4c,4a) In a very dirty state, it could hardly be climbed without prior cleaning. The first pitch is not well protected. Start just left of the holly tree near the centre of the buttress. 1. 27m Climb the steep slab on good holds to a small ledge beneath an overhang and move diagonally left along a short, open, greasy crack to the base of the wall. Climb the wall going up and right on small widely-spaced holds, following the rough line of a shallow vegetated groove to reach a wide, grassy ledge. Belay at the back of the ledge. 2, 25m Climb the slabs at the back of the ledge diagonally right via quartzy seams to reach the base of a crack at 8m and climb this up the centre of the face, finishing on small holds towards the top. Belay well back. Download topos of the next 3 routes at Glenmalure North 3 THE WILD WIND BLOWS * 25m VS (4b) Start behind the holly tree moving in from the left and follow a more or less direct line to the top, at first up the right side of the raised narrow section of slab to a vegetated ledge and then up a crack and slab directly to the top, finishing to the right of the crux of Ciúnas. NO LINGERING ** 25m HVS (5a) Start immediately right of the holly tree. Climb the slab to reach blocky rock to the left of the overhang. Traverse right beneath this for several metres to the base of an arête forming the left wall of the obvious chimney. Move up and gain the slab above on the left side of the exposed arête. Make delicate balance moves up along the arête towards easier ground and the finish. LEFTIESWELL * 27m S (4a) Start on the right side of the buttress, right of the holly tree, under and slightly left of the obvious chimney at half-height. 1. 18m Climb the slab, trending right to the base of the chimney. Climb the right wall of the chimney to a grassy terrace and belay. 2. 9m Crux pitch. Go straight up from the top of the chimney which narrows to a crack with two awkward moves. Belay well back. Download topos of the next 3 routes at Glenmalure North 4 Also download topos of the next 5 routes at Glenmalure North full ANTICYCLONE 25m HS (4b) Start just right of Leftieswell about 8m right of the holly tree and at a right-trending quartz crack. 1. 15m Follow the thin knobby quartz line up to the ledge, continue up left of loose blocks to another ledge and then go diagonally right to finish at the belay ledge. 2. 10m Climb out left and go up the slab to the Leftieswell chimney; finish up just right of the chimney via the slab. Struggle through furze to belay well back on the terrace. ALIENS WAITING ROOM * 22m E1 (5b) This eliminate type slab climb, which has an unprotected crux, starts 2m to the left of the Cyclone Corner crack below a steep narrow slab going up to the left side of an overhang with a holly tree. Climb the delicate slab (avoiding any recourse to the crack) working gradually left towards the top to a small pedestal foothold on the left side of the slab above a heather ledge. Edge back right and pull up on the rounded top edge of the slab to the break just left of the overhang. Continue up the easier slab to the left of the overhang to the terrace. CYCLONE CORNER 52m VS (4c,4a) Start at the bottom right of the buttress at a partly vegetated crack which runs up to an overhang with a holly tree. Nature is reclaiming this route. 1. 22m Climb the crack to the overhang. Move out slightly left onto the steep slab and around the overhang (crux) to a stance. Climb the corner above, which is awkward to start. Belay at the terrace. 2. 30m Start in the middle of the wall (just right of Stone Maiden) about 2m left of the obvious crack. Climb up on small edges passing a diagonal crack to just below a horizontal break. Move out left to a heathery stance. Move up and diagonally right along a crack for about 6m and gain a slabby edge. Follow this to the top The following two climbs start off the higher left-hand level of the offset grassy terrace. PROCTOR'S SLAB 23m S (3c) Gives a good finish to Leftieswell. From the top of Leftieswell climb the centre of the obvious slab on good hidden holds to the top. THE VALLEY WILD 23m HS (4a/b) Start at the right-hand end of the higher terrace at an area of light-coloured quartzy rock. Go up a short curving crack and the short horizontal joints above it to reach the base of a crack. Climb the smooth slab to the left of the crack (crux)to finish. The next four routes start off the lower right-hand grassy terrace. This terrace can be reached by scrambling up the right-hand side of the buttress. GRANISTER 16m S (4a) Start at the left side of the terrace below a dirty corner. Climb up just to the right of a right-trending quartzy crack, to the small overhang. Go straight up over the overhang and belay on a block. STONE MAIDEN 30m S (4a) Start just to the right of Granister. Surmount the slight bulge (thread runner above it), move right and climb up just left of the narrow chimney over short horizontal joints until just level with the top of Granister. Finish up the tiers of rock and vegetation to the right of the arête. SLEEP-WALKER 14m VD Takes the long crack 4m to the right of Stone Maiden which leads up into the narrow chimney on the left side of the small overhang. Bridge up the crack and chimney to the top. TOE THE LINE 15m VS (4b) Start just right of Sleep-Walker and climb up a small ledge and the smooth wall to beneath the right-hand side of the overhang. Up past the break and work out right for 2m on small footholds to gain a short wide crack. Up this to finish. ====GLENMALURE LE BUET==== Immediately above the car park on the Northern slope of the valley is a small sport crag with 4 completed lines. The rock is very compact granite/schist with no natural protection. 4 routes have been equipped. Location: 52°59'21.7\"N 6°24'26.5\"W https://goo.gl/maps/8ugvbBqTAEDQPNb46 From left to right facing the crag: - FROM THE RIVER 12m 6a+ - LE BUET 12m 6b+ - TO THE SEA 15m 6c+ - RIGHT OF RETURN 12m 7a ====BARAVORE VALLEY/ BENLEAGH==== (also known as Fraughan Rock Glen or The Three Valleys or Bolinaskea - Buaile na Sciatha ) is approached by crossing the ford/bridge on the Avonbeg at Baravore turning towards the hostel and after 100m heading up the obvious spur to the left of the old mine building. On reaching the forest road follow it in a generally southwest to west direction until the scree slopes on the right-hand side of the valley come into sight above the forest, more or less directly ahead. Follow a slightly descending section of the track to a sharp left-hand bend,marked on the left by a large boulder, and continue for 100m to the foot of the falling ground. Turn in to the right and skirt some scraggy trees to a moraine which leads up through the forest to steep grass and heather slopes. Above can be seen a prominent gully to the left of The Rock of Baravore -a vegetated wall of rock forming the rim of the valley. This is known to climbers as Great Gully and is reached from the car park in less than one hour. The setting is wild and impressive with some excellent climbing. The Gully is 250m higher than Glendalough crag and so is more prone to cold winds. It shows its magnificence best on a fine day while in dull weather it can provide preparation for the Alps. Unstable or loose blocks are possible, due to the thin, serrated nature of the ridge, and care should always be exercised. Active erosion in the higher reaches of the gully makes descent difficult and unpleasant, particularly in rock boots. An abseil chain has been placed at the top of Great Gully Route. If this is to your satisfaction it will just be possible to reach the gully floor by using two 50m ropes. The climbs are found on the right-hand side when facing up the Gully and are described from the bottom upwards. See the location of the crag at Routes 22 & 45 and location of crag Download topos of the crag at Page 251 FLEETING SUMMER 32m E1 (5b) This route starts at a toe of rock at the bottom right side of the gully, 2m to the right of the Great Gully Route corner. Gain the narrow slab delicately from the left and climb up to a small overhang which is taken on its front face. Move left and up the short grassy corner to a heather ledge beneath an undercut hanging groove. Gain the groove with difficulty and reach up to a horizontal break. Traverse out left onto the steep slab and climb up steeply to reach a narrow foot-ledge at the break. Continue up the centre of the slab and easier blocks beyond to gain a good thread and flake belay on the right side of the ridge. To escape, scramble down to the right. GREAT GULLY RIDGE ** 140m HS (4a,3c,4b,4a) This climb takes a line up the rock ridge which bounds the right-hand side of Great Gully; good clean climbing in a very fine situation. Best enjoyed with not more than 4 people on the route to savour the full flavour. Big groups take away from the experience and the tail-enders can expect to arrive home late. Start in the corner at the bottom right of the gully. (1) 10m Climb the corner to wide crack. Belay under a roof at the top of crack (2) 45m Gain the ridge and follow it directly to large stepping stones and easy ground. (3) 40m Move rightwards up steps and then climb a crack in the right corner of the slab above (crux) or more easily move up right via leaning corners and then back left above the crack. Gain height to a large platform visible from below. (4) 45m Move rightward to a short grassy wall. Move left up this for 3m to the base of a chimney with jammed blocks. Climb these to the top. Pitch not identified by anyone who sought it. It may describe going up via the off-width crack in the variation below. Variation: (4a) Climb a short grassy bank and step up left onto a wide ledge beneath an overhanging off width crack. Move on and down to the end of the ledge (belaying here reduces rope drag) and step up onto a small heathery ledge in a corner. Climb the corner to a ledge and continue up a cracked wall above it. Scramble across the face to a pointed detached block. Finish up the slope behind this. Overview Of Great Gully Ridge Photo: Nick Simons D-FOR-DOG* 18m VS (4b) Start just left of Great Gully corner at the bottom of the obvious clean slab. Climb the arête to the overhang and follow the parallel cracks to the ridge. FLAKE* 15m E1 (5b) Start 15m up on the right side of the gully. Climb broken rock to a grassy ledge beneath the triangular face. Follow the crack-line, trending leftwards to the sharp flake then move rightwards to finish at the boulder on the ridge. THE RAMP 15m VS (4b) Take the steep ramp to the left of the triangular face to the large overhang. Move right to finish. NOT Z BACKWARDS* 25m HVS (5b) Unknown first accent. LET THE HARE SIT 20m VS (4a/4b) From the top of the detached block this route takes the line via the short cracks above it (crux)then up easier ground on good holds to the half way mark. Veer up steeply right on large holds and good friction a meter or so in from the right edge to gain G.G.Ridge. THREE MAD SHEEP (Great Gully) 27m VS (High in the grade) Start on the right hand side of the giant rock pedestal, where the pedestal butts up to the face two meters right of Pauls Crack. Pitch one 22 meters VS. Start at the very wide crack almost like a chimney at the bottom. Climb this all the way as it closes in to form a crack, difficulty increases with height. Athletically finish lay back moves from rounded pulls. Belay on top of grass ledge from nut on face and large block on top of Gully Crack. Pitch two S 5 meters. Step out right and climb wall above on rounded but good friction holds, tending steeply to right. Good belay on ridge. PAUL'S CRACK 18m VS 4b Starts a further 20m up the gully. This route follows the obvious wide crack on the right side of the giant rock pedestal. Z BACKWARDS* 25m VS (4a/4b) Start under the left end of the overhang. Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

Climb up to a short crack-line and to a horizontal crack and then slant up right to an overhang which is surmounted near its right side. Continue up the right-trending, juggy crack until another crack leads out left. Follow this to a smooth lichenous scoop. Move up this to below a steep bulge and climb this poorly protected section to finish on a grassy ledge. BLAST OFF 52m VS (4c,4a) In a very dirty state, it could hardly be climbed without prior cleaning. The first pitch is not well protected. Start just left of the holly tree near the centre of the buttress. 1. 27m Climb the steep slab on good holds to a small ledge beneath an overhang and move diagonally left along a short, open, greasy crack to the base of the wall. Climb the wall going up and right on small widely-spaced holds, following the rough line of a shallow vegetated groove to reach a wide, grassy ledge. Belay at the back of the ledge. 2, 25m Climb the slabs at the back of the ledge diagonally right via quartzy seams to reach the base of a crack at 8m and climb this up the centre of the face, finishing on small holds towards the top. Belay well back.

Struggle through furze to belay well back on the terrace. ALIENS WAITING ROOM * 22m E1 (5b) This eliminate type slab climb, which has an unprotected crux, starts 2m to the left of the Cyclone Corner crack below a steep narrow slab going up to the left side of an overhang with a holly tree. Climb the delicate slab (avoiding any recourse to the crack) working gradually left towards the top to a small pedestal foothold on the left side of the slab above a heather ledge. Edge back right and pull up on the rounded top edge of the slab to the break just left of the overhang. Continue up the easier slab to the left of the overhang to the terrace. CYCLONE CORNER 52m VS (4c,4a) Start at the bottom right of the buttress at a partly vegetated crack which runs up to an overhang with a holly tree. Nature is reclaiming this route. 1. 22m Climb the crack to the overhang. Move out slightly left onto the steep slab and around the overhang (crux) to a stance. Climb the corner above, which is awkward to start. Belay at the terrace. 2. 30m Start in the middle of the wall (just right of Stone Maiden) about 2m left of the obvious crack. Climb up on small edges passing a diagonal crack to just below a horizontal break. Move out left to a heathery stance. Move up and diagonally right along a crack for about 6m and gain a slabby edge. Follow this to the top The following two climbs start off the higher left-hand level of the offset grassy terrace. PROCTOR'S SLAB 23m S (3c) Gives a good finish to Leftieswell. From the top of Leftieswell climb the centre of the obvious slab on good hidden holds to the top. THE VALLEY WILD 23m HS (4a/b) Start at the right-hand end of the higher terrace at an area of light-coloured quartzy rock. Go up a short curving crack and the short horizontal joints above it to reach the base of a crack. Climb the smooth slab to the left of the crack (crux)to finish. The next four routes start off the lower right-hand grassy terrace. This terrace can be reached by scrambling up the right-hand side of the buttress. GRANISTER 16m S (4a) Start at the left side of the terrace below a dirty corner. Climb up just to the right of a right-trending quartzy crack, to the small overhang. Go straight up over the overhang and belay on a block. STONE MAIDEN 30m S (4a) Start just to the right of Granister. Surmount the slight bulge (thread runner above it), move right and climb up just left of the narrow chimney over short horizontal joints until just level with the top of Granister. Finish up the tiers of rock and vegetation to the right of the arête. SLEEP-WALKER 14m VD Takes the long crack 4m to the right of Stone Maiden which leads up into the narrow chimney on the left side of the small overhang. Bridge up the crack and chimney to the top. TOE THE LINE 15m VS (4b) Start just right of Sleep-Walker and climb up a small ledge and the smooth wall to beneath the right-hand side of the overhang. Up past the break and work out right for 2m on small footholds to gain a short wide crack. Up this to finish. ====GLENMALURE LE BUET==== Immediately above the car park on the Northern slope of the valley is a small sport crag with 4 completed lines. The rock is very compact granite/schist with no natural protection. 4 routes have been equipped. Location: 52°59'21.7\"N 6°24'26.5\"W https://goo.gl/maps/8ugvbBqTAEDQPNb46 From left to right facing the crag: - FROM THE RIVER 12m 6a+ - LE BUET 12m 6b+ - TO THE SEA 15m 6c+ - RIGHT OF RETURN 12m 7a ====BARAVORE VALLEY/ BENLEAGH==== (also known as Fraughan Rock Glen or The Three Valleys or Bolinaskea - Buaile na Sciatha ) is approached by crossing the ford/bridge on the Avonbeg at Baravore turning towards the hostel and after 100m heading up the obvious spur to the left of the old mine building. On reaching the forest road follow it in a generally southwest to west direction until the scree slopes on the right-hand side of the valley come into sight above the forest, more or less directly ahead. Follow a slightly descending section of the track to a sharp left-hand bend,marked on the left by a large boulder, and continue for 100m to the foot of the falling ground. Turn in to the right and skirt some scraggy trees to a moraine which leads up through the forest to steep grass and heather slopes. Above can be seen a prominent gully to the left of The Rock of Baravore -a vegetated wall of rock forming the rim of the valley. This is known to climbers as Great Gully and is reached from the car park in less than one hour. The setting is wild and impressive with some excellent climbing. The Gully is 250m higher than Glendalough crag and so is more prone to cold winds. It shows its magnificence best on a fine day while in dull weather it can provide preparation for the Alps. Unstable or loose blocks are possible, due to the thin, serrated nature of the ridge, and care should always be exercised. Active erosion in the higher reaches of the gully makes descent difficult and unpleasant, particularly in rock boots. An abseil chain has been placed at the top of Great Gully Route. If this is to your satisfaction it will just be possible to reach the gully floor by using two 50m ropes. The climbs are found on the right-hand side when facing up the Gully and are described from the bottom upwards. See the location of the crag at Routes 22 & 45 and location of crag Download topos of the crag at Page 251 FLEETING SUMMER 32m E1 (5b) This route starts at a toe of rock at the bottom right side of the gully, 2m to the right of the Great Gully Route corner. Gain the narrow slab delicately from the left and climb up to a small overhang which is taken on its front face. Move left and up the short grassy corner to a heather ledge beneath an undercut hanging groove. Gain the groove with difficulty and reach up to a horizontal break. Traverse out left onto the steep slab and climb up steeply to reach a narrow foot-ledge at the break. Continue up the centre of the slab and easier blocks beyond to gain a good thread and flake belay on the right side of the ridge. To escape, scramble down to the right. GREAT GULLY RIDGE ** 140m HS (4a,3c,4b,4a) This climb takes a line up the rock ridge which bounds the right-hand side of Great Gully; good clean climbing in a very fine situation. Best enjoyed with not more than 4 people on the route to savour the full flavour. Big groups take away from the experience and the tail-enders can expect to arrive home late. Start in the corner at the bottom right of the gully. (1) 10m Climb the corner to wide crack. Belay under a roof at the top of crack (2) 45m Gain the ridge and follow it directly to large stepping stones and easy ground. (3) 40m Move rightwards up steps and then climb a crack in the right corner of the slab above (crux) or more easily move up right via leaning corners and then back left above the crack. Gain height to a large platform visible from below. (4) 45m Move rightward to a short grassy wall. Move left up this for 3m to the base of a chimney with jammed blocks. Climb these to the top. Pitch not identified by anyone who sought it. It may describe going up via the off-width crack in the variation below. Variation: (4a) Climb a short grassy bank and step up left onto a wide ledge beneath an overhanging off width crack. Move on and down to the end of the ledge (belaying here reduces rope drag) and step up onto a small heathery ledge in a corner. Climb the corner to a ledge and continue up a cracked wall above it. Scramble across the face to a pointed detached block. Finish up the slope behind this. Overview Of Great Gully Ridge Photo: Nick Simons D-FOR-DOG* 18m VS (4b) Start just left of Great Gully corner at the bottom of the obvious clean slab. Climb the arête to the overhang and follow the parallel cracks to the ridge. FLAKE* 15m E1 (5b) Start 15m up on the right side of the gully. Climb broken rock to a grassy ledge beneath the triangular face. Follow the crack-line, trending leftwards to the sharp flake then move rightwards to finish at the boulder on the ridge. THE RAMP 15m VS (4b) Take the steep ramp to the left of the triangular face to the large overhang. Move right to finish. NOT Z BACKWARDS* 25m HVS (5b) Unknown first accent. LET THE HARE SIT 20m VS (4a/4b) From the top of the detached block this route takes the line via the short cracks above it (crux)then up easier ground on good holds to the half way mark. Veer up steeply right on large holds and good friction a meter or so in from the right edge to gain G.G.Ridge. THREE MAD SHEEP (Great Gully) 27m VS (High in the grade) Start on the right hand side of the giant rock pedestal, where the pedestal butts up to the face two meters right of Pauls Crack. Pitch one 22 meters VS. Start at the very wide crack almost like a chimney at the bottom. Climb this all the way as it closes in to form a crack, difficulty increases with height. Athletically finish lay back moves from rounded pulls. Belay on top of grass ledge from nut on face and large block on top of Gully Crack. Pitch two S 5 meters. Step out right and climb wall above on rounded but good friction holds, tending steeply to right. Good belay on ridge. PAUL'S CRACK 18m VS 4b Starts a further 20m up the gully. This route follows the obvious wide crack on the right side of the giant rock pedestal. Z BACKWARDS* 25m VS (4a/4b) Start under the left end of the overhang. Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

Struggle through furze to belay well back on the terrace. ALIENS WAITING ROOM * 22m E1 (5b) This eliminate type slab climb, which has an unprotected crux, starts 2m to the left of the Cyclone Corner crack below a steep narrow slab going up to the left side of an overhang with a holly tree. Climb the delicate slab (avoiding any recourse to the crack) working gradually left towards the top to a small pedestal foothold on the left side of the slab above a heather ledge. Edge back right and pull up on the rounded top edge of the slab to the break just left of the overhang. Continue up the easier slab to the left of the overhang to the terrace. CYCLONE CORNER 52m VS (4c,4a) Start at the bottom right of the buttress at a partly vegetated crack which runs up to an overhang with a holly tree. Nature is reclaiming this route. 1. 22m Climb the crack to the overhang. Move out slightly left onto the steep slab and around the overhang (crux) to a stance. Climb the corner above, which is awkward to start. Belay at the terrace. 2. 30m Start in the middle of the wall (just right of Stone Maiden) about 2m left of the obvious crack. Climb up on small edges passing a diagonal crack to just below a horizontal break. Move out left to a heathery stance. Move up and diagonally right along a crack for about 6m and gain a slabby edge. Follow this to the top The following two climbs start off the higher left-hand level of the offset grassy terrace. PROCTOR'S SLAB 23m S (3c) Gives a good finish to Leftieswell. From the top of Leftieswell climb the centre of the obvious slab on good hidden holds to the top. THE VALLEY WILD 23m HS (4a/b) Start at the right-hand end of the higher terrace at an area of light-coloured quartzy rock. Go up a short curving crack and the short horizontal joints above it to reach the base of a crack. Climb the smooth slab to the left of the crack (crux)to finish. The next four routes start off the lower right-hand grassy terrace. This terrace can be reached by scrambling up the right-hand side of the buttress. GRANISTER 16m S (4a) Start at the left side of the terrace below a dirty corner. Climb up just to the right of a right-trending quartzy crack, to the small overhang. Go straight up over the overhang and belay on a block. STONE MAIDEN 30m S (4a) Start just to the right of Granister. Surmount the slight bulge (thread runner above it), move right and climb up just left of the narrow chimney over short horizontal joints until just level with the top of Granister. Finish up the tiers of rock and vegetation to the right of the arête. SLEEP-WALKER 14m VD Takes the long crack 4m to the right of Stone Maiden which leads up into the narrow chimney on the left side of the small overhang. Bridge up the crack and chimney to the top. TOE THE LINE 15m VS (4b) Start just right of Sleep-Walker and climb up a small ledge and the smooth wall to beneath the right-hand side of the overhang. Up past the break and work out right for 2m on small footholds to gain a short wide crack. Up this to finish. ====GLENMALURE LE BUET==== Immediately above the car park on the Northern slope of the valley is a small sport crag with 4 completed lines. The rock is very compact granite/schist with no natural protection. 4 routes have been equipped. Location: 52°59'21.7\"N 6°24'26.5\"W https://goo.gl/maps/8ugvbBqTAEDQPNb46 From left to right facing the crag: - FROM THE RIVER 12m 6a+ - LE BUET 12m 6b+ - TO THE SEA 15m 6c+ - RIGHT OF RETURN 12m 7a ====BARAVORE VALLEY/ BENLEAGH==== (also known as Fraughan Rock Glen or The Three Valleys or Bolinaskea - Buaile na Sciatha ) is approached by crossing the ford/bridge on the Avonbeg at Baravore turning towards the hostel and after 100m heading up the obvious spur to the left of the old mine building. On reaching the forest road follow it in a generally southwest to west direction until the scree slopes on the right-hand side of the valley come into sight above the forest, more or less directly ahead. Follow a slightly descending section of the track to a sharp left-hand bend,marked on the left by a large boulder, and continue for 100m to the foot of the falling ground. Turn in to the right and skirt some scraggy trees to a moraine which leads up through the forest to steep grass and heather slopes. Above can be seen a prominent gully to the left of The Rock of Baravore -a vegetated wall of rock forming the rim of the valley. This is known to climbers as Great Gully and is reached from the car park in less than one hour. The setting is wild and impressive with some excellent climbing. The Gully is 250m higher than Glendalough crag and so is more prone to cold winds. It shows its magnificence best on a fine day while in dull weather it can provide preparation for the Alps. Unstable or loose blocks are possible, due to the thin, serrated nature of the ridge, and care should always be exercised. Active erosion in the higher reaches of the gully makes descent difficult and unpleasant, particularly in rock boots. An abseil chain has been placed at the top of Great Gully Route. If this is to your satisfaction it will just be possible to reach the gully floor by using two 50m ropes. The climbs are found on the right-hand side when facing up the Gully and are described from the bottom upwards. See the location of the crag at Routes 22 & 45 and location of crag Download topos of the crag at Page 251 FLEETING SUMMER 32m E1 (5b) This route starts at a toe of rock at the bottom right side of the gully, 2m to the right of the Great Gully Route corner. Gain the narrow slab delicately from the left and climb up to a small overhang which is taken on its front face. Move left and up the short grassy corner to a heather ledge beneath an undercut hanging groove. Gain the groove with difficulty and reach up to a horizontal break. Traverse out left onto the steep slab and climb up steeply to reach a narrow foot-ledge at the break. Continue up the centre of the slab and easier blocks beyond to gain a good thread and flake belay on the right side of the ridge. To escape, scramble down to the right. GREAT GULLY RIDGE ** 140m HS (4a,3c,4b,4a) This climb takes a line up the rock ridge which bounds the right-hand side of Great Gully; good clean climbing in a very fine situation. Best enjoyed with not more than 4 people on the route to savour the full flavour. Big groups take away from the experience and the tail-enders can expect to arrive home late. Start in the corner at the bottom right of the gully. (1) 10m Climb the corner to wide crack. Belay under a roof at the top of crack (2) 45m Gain the ridge and follow it directly to large stepping stones and easy ground. (3) 40m Move rightwards up steps and then climb a crack in the right corner of the slab above (crux) or more easily move up right via leaning corners and then back left above the crack. Gain height to a large platform visible from below. (4) 45m Move rightward to a short grassy wall. Move left up this for 3m to the base of a chimney with jammed blocks. Climb these to the top. Pitch not identified by anyone who sought it. It may describe going up via the off-width crack in the variation below. Variation: (4a) Climb a short grassy bank and step up left onto a wide ledge beneath an overhanging off width crack. Move on and down to the end of the ledge (belaying here reduces rope drag) and step up onto a small heathery ledge in a corner. Climb the corner to a ledge and continue up a cracked wall above it. Scramble across the face to a pointed detached block. Finish up the slope behind this. Overview Of Great Gully Ridge Photo: Nick Simons D-FOR-DOG* 18m VS (4b) Start just left of Great Gully corner at the bottom of the obvious clean slab. Climb the arête to the overhang and follow the parallel cracks to the ridge. FLAKE* 15m E1 (5b) Start 15m up on the right side of the gully. Climb broken rock to a grassy ledge beneath the triangular face. Follow the crack-line, trending leftwards to the sharp flake then move rightwards to finish at the boulder on the ridge. THE RAMP 15m VS (4b) Take the steep ramp to the left of the triangular face to the large overhang. Move right to finish. NOT Z BACKWARDS* 25m HVS (5b) Unknown first accent. LET THE HARE SIT 20m VS (4a/4b) From the top of the detached block this route takes the line via the short cracks above it (crux)then up easier ground on good holds to the half way mark. Veer up steeply right on large holds and good friction a meter or so in from the right edge to gain G.G.Ridge. THREE MAD SHEEP (Great Gully) 27m VS (High in the grade) Start on the right hand side of the giant rock pedestal, where the pedestal butts up to the face two meters right of Pauls Crack. Pitch one 22 meters VS. Start at the very wide crack almost like a chimney at the bottom. Climb this all the way as it closes in to form a crack, difficulty increases with height. Athletically finish lay back moves from rounded pulls. Belay on top of grass ledge from nut on face and large block on top of Gully Crack. Pitch two S 5 meters. Step out right and climb wall above on rounded but good friction holds, tending steeply to right. Good belay on ridge. PAUL'S CRACK 18m VS 4b Starts a further 20m up the gully. This route follows the obvious wide crack on the right side of the giant rock pedestal. Z BACKWARDS* 25m VS (4a/4b) Start under the left end of the overhang. Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

Climb the delicate slab (avoiding any recourse to the crack) working gradually left towards the top to a small pedestal foothold on the left side of the slab above a heather ledge. Edge back right and pull up on the rounded top edge of the slab to the break just left of the overhang. Continue up the easier slab to the left of the overhang to the terrace. CYCLONE CORNER 52m VS (4c,4a) Start at the bottom right of the buttress at a partly vegetated crack which runs up to an overhang with a holly tree. Nature is reclaiming this route. 1. 22m Climb the crack to the overhang. Move out slightly left onto the steep slab and around the overhang (crux) to a stance. Climb the corner above, which is awkward to start. Belay at the terrace. 2. 30m Start in the middle of the wall (just right of Stone Maiden) about 2m left of the obvious crack. Climb up on small edges passing a diagonal crack to just below a horizontal break. Move out left to a heathery stance. Move up and diagonally right along a crack for about 6m and gain a slabby edge. Follow this to the top The following two climbs start off the higher left-hand level of the offset grassy terrace. PROCTOR'S SLAB 23m S (3c) Gives a good finish to Leftieswell. From the top of Leftieswell climb the centre of the obvious slab on good hidden holds to the top. THE VALLEY WILD 23m HS (4a/b) Start at the right-hand end of the higher terrace at an area of light-coloured quartzy rock. Go up a short curving crack and the short horizontal joints above it to reach the base of a crack. Climb the smooth slab to the left of the crack (crux)to finish. The next four routes start off the lower right-hand grassy terrace. This terrace can be reached by scrambling up the right-hand side of the buttress. GRANISTER 16m S (4a) Start at the left side of the terrace below a dirty corner. Climb up just to the right of a right-trending quartzy crack, to the small overhang. Go straight up over the overhang and belay on a block. STONE MAIDEN 30m S (4a) Start just to the right of Granister. Surmount the slight bulge (thread runner above it), move right and climb up just left of the narrow chimney over short horizontal joints until just level with the top of Granister. Finish up the tiers of rock and vegetation to the right of the arête. SLEEP-WALKER 14m VD Takes the long crack 4m to the right of Stone Maiden which leads up into the narrow chimney on the left side of the small overhang. Bridge up the crack and chimney to the top. TOE THE LINE 15m VS (4b) Start just right of Sleep-Walker and climb up a small ledge and the smooth wall to beneath the right-hand side of the overhang. Up past the break and work out right for 2m on small footholds to gain a short wide crack. Up this to finish. ====GLENMALURE LE BUET==== Immediately above the car park on the Northern slope of the valley is a small sport crag with 4 completed lines. The rock is very compact granite/schist with no natural protection. 4 routes have been equipped. Location: 52°59'21.7\"N 6°24'26.5\"W https://goo.gl/maps/8ugvbBqTAEDQPNb46 From left to right facing the crag: - FROM THE RIVER 12m 6a+ - LE BUET 12m 6b+ - TO THE SEA 15m 6c+ - RIGHT OF RETURN 12m 7a ====BARAVORE VALLEY/ BENLEAGH==== (also known as Fraughan Rock Glen or The Three Valleys or Bolinaskea - Buaile na Sciatha ) is approached by crossing the ford/bridge on the Avonbeg at Baravore turning towards the hostel and after 100m heading up the obvious spur to the left of the old mine building. On reaching the forest road follow it in a generally southwest to west direction until the scree slopes on the right-hand side of the valley come into sight above the forest, more or less directly ahead. Follow a slightly descending section of the track to a sharp left-hand bend,marked on the left by a large boulder, and continue for 100m to the foot of the falling ground. Turn in to the right and skirt some scraggy trees to a moraine which leads up through the forest to steep grass and heather slopes. Above can be seen a prominent gully to the left of The Rock of Baravore -a vegetated wall of rock forming the rim of the valley. This is known to climbers as Great Gully and is reached from the car park in less than one hour. The setting is wild and impressive with some excellent climbing. The Gully is 250m higher than Glendalough crag and so is more prone to cold winds. It shows its magnificence best on a fine day while in dull weather it can provide preparation for the Alps. Unstable or loose blocks are possible, due to the thin, serrated nature of the ridge, and care should always be exercised. Active erosion in the higher reaches of the gully makes descent difficult and unpleasant, particularly in rock boots. An abseil chain has been placed at the top of Great Gully Route. If this is to your satisfaction it will just be possible to reach the gully floor by using two 50m ropes. The climbs are found on the right-hand side when facing up the Gully and are described from the bottom upwards. See the location of the crag at Routes 22 & 45 and location of crag Download topos of the crag at Page 251 FLEETING SUMMER 32m E1 (5b) This route starts at a toe of rock at the bottom right side of the gully, 2m to the right of the Great Gully Route corner. Gain the narrow slab delicately from the left and climb up to a small overhang which is taken on its front face. Move left and up the short grassy corner to a heather ledge beneath an undercut hanging groove. Gain the groove with difficulty and reach up to a horizontal break. Traverse out left onto the steep slab and climb up steeply to reach a narrow foot-ledge at the break. Continue up the centre of the slab and easier blocks beyond to gain a good thread and flake belay on the right side of the ridge. To escape, scramble down to the right. GREAT GULLY RIDGE ** 140m HS (4a,3c,4b,4a) This climb takes a line up the rock ridge which bounds the right-hand side of Great Gully; good clean climbing in a very fine situation. Best enjoyed with not more than 4 people on the route to savour the full flavour. Big groups take away from the experience and the tail-enders can expect to arrive home late. Start in the corner at the bottom right of the gully. (1) 10m Climb the corner to wide crack. Belay under a roof at the top of crack (2) 45m Gain the ridge and follow it directly to large stepping stones and easy ground. (3) 40m Move rightwards up steps and then climb a crack in the right corner of the slab above (crux) or more easily move up right via leaning corners and then back left above the crack. Gain height to a large platform visible from below. (4) 45m Move rightward to a short grassy wall. Move left up this for 3m to the base of a chimney with jammed blocks. Climb these to the top. Pitch not identified by anyone who sought it. It may describe going up via the off-width crack in the variation below. Variation: (4a) Climb a short grassy bank and step up left onto a wide ledge beneath an overhanging off width crack. Move on and down to the end of the ledge (belaying here reduces rope drag) and step up onto a small heathery ledge in a corner. Climb the corner to a ledge and continue up a cracked wall above it. Scramble across the face to a pointed detached block. Finish up the slope behind this. Overview Of Great Gully Ridge Photo: Nick Simons D-FOR-DOG* 18m VS (4b) Start just left of Great Gully corner at the bottom of the obvious clean slab. Climb the arête to the overhang and follow the parallel cracks to the ridge. FLAKE* 15m E1 (5b) Start 15m up on the right side of the gully. Climb broken rock to a grassy ledge beneath the triangular face. Follow the crack-line, trending leftwards to the sharp flake then move rightwards to finish at the boulder on the ridge. THE RAMP 15m VS (4b) Take the steep ramp to the left of the triangular face to the large overhang. Move right to finish. NOT Z BACKWARDS* 25m HVS (5b) Unknown first accent. LET THE HARE SIT 20m VS (4a/4b) From the top of the detached block this route takes the line via the short cracks above it (crux)then up easier ground on good holds to the half way mark. Veer up steeply right on large holds and good friction a meter or so in from the right edge to gain G.G.Ridge. THREE MAD SHEEP (Great Gully) 27m VS (High in the grade) Start on the right hand side of the giant rock pedestal, where the pedestal butts up to the face two meters right of Pauls Crack. Pitch one 22 meters VS. Start at the very wide crack almost like a chimney at the bottom. Climb this all the way as it closes in to form a crack, difficulty increases with height. Athletically finish lay back moves from rounded pulls. Belay on top of grass ledge from nut on face and large block on top of Gully Crack. Pitch two S 5 meters. Step out right and climb wall above on rounded but good friction holds, tending steeply to right. Good belay on ridge. PAUL'S CRACK 18m VS 4b Starts a further 20m up the gully. This route follows the obvious wide crack on the right side of the giant rock pedestal. Z BACKWARDS* 25m VS (4a/4b) Start under the left end of the overhang. Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

Struggle through furze to belay well back on the terrace. ALIENS WAITING ROOM * 22m E1 (5b) This eliminate type slab climb, which has an unprotected crux, starts 2m to the left of the Cyclone Corner crack below a steep narrow slab going up to the left side of an overhang with a holly tree. Climb the delicate slab (avoiding any recourse to the crack) working gradually left towards the top to a small pedestal foothold on the left side of the slab above a heather ledge. Edge back right and pull up on the rounded top edge of the slab to the break just left of the overhang. Continue up the easier slab to the left of the overhang to the terrace. CYCLONE CORNER 52m VS (4c,4a) Start at the bottom right of the buttress at a partly vegetated crack which runs up to an overhang with a holly tree. Nature is reclaiming this route. 1. 22m Climb the crack to the overhang. Move out slightly left onto the steep slab and around the overhang (crux) to a stance. Climb the corner above, which is awkward to start. Belay at the terrace. 2. 30m Start in the middle of the wall (just right of Stone Maiden) about 2m left of the obvious crack. Climb up on small edges passing a diagonal crack to just below a horizontal break. Move out left to a heathery stance. Move up and diagonally right along a crack for about 6m and gain a slabby edge. Follow this to the top The following two climbs start off the higher left-hand level of the offset grassy terrace. PROCTOR'S SLAB 23m S (3c) Gives a good finish to Leftieswell. From the top of Leftieswell climb the centre of the obvious slab on good hidden holds to the top. THE VALLEY WILD 23m HS (4a/b) Start at the right-hand end of the higher terrace at an area of light-coloured quartzy rock. Go up a short curving crack and the short horizontal joints above it to reach the base of a crack. Climb the smooth slab to the left of the crack (crux)to finish. The next four routes start off the lower right-hand grassy terrace. This terrace can be reached by scrambling up the right-hand side of the buttress. GRANISTER 16m S (4a) Start at the left side of the terrace below a dirty corner. Climb up just to the right of a right-trending quartzy crack, to the small overhang. Go straight up over the overhang and belay on a block. STONE MAIDEN 30m S (4a) Start just to the right of Granister. Surmount the slight bulge (thread runner above it), move right and climb up just left of the narrow chimney over short horizontal joints until just level with the top of Granister. Finish up the tiers of rock and vegetation to the right of the arête. SLEEP-WALKER 14m VD Takes the long crack 4m to the right of Stone Maiden which leads up into the narrow chimney on the left side of the small overhang. Bridge up the crack and chimney to the top. TOE THE LINE 15m VS (4b) Start just right of Sleep-Walker and climb up a small ledge and the smooth wall to beneath the right-hand side of the overhang. Up past the break and work out right for 2m on small footholds to gain a short wide crack. Up this to finish. ====GLENMALURE LE BUET==== Immediately above the car park on the Northern slope of the valley is a small sport crag with 4 completed lines. The rock is very compact granite/schist with no natural protection. 4 routes have been equipped. Location: 52°59'21.7\"N 6°24'26.5\"W https://goo.gl/maps/8ugvbBqTAEDQPNb46 From left to right facing the crag: - FROM THE RIVER 12m 6a+ - LE BUET 12m 6b+ - TO THE SEA 15m 6c+ - RIGHT OF RETURN 12m 7a ====BARAVORE VALLEY/ BENLEAGH==== (also known as Fraughan Rock Glen or The Three Valleys or Bolinaskea - Buaile na Sciatha ) is approached by crossing the ford/bridge on the Avonbeg at Baravore turning towards the hostel and after 100m heading up the obvious spur to the left of the old mine building. On reaching the forest road follow it in a generally southwest to west direction until the scree slopes on the right-hand side of the valley come into sight above the forest, more or less directly ahead. Follow a slightly descending section of the track to a sharp left-hand bend,marked on the left by a large boulder, and continue for 100m to the foot of the falling ground. Turn in to the right and skirt some scraggy trees to a moraine which leads up through the forest to steep grass and heather slopes. Above can be seen a prominent gully to the left of The Rock of Baravore -a vegetated wall of rock forming the rim of the valley. This is known to climbers as Great Gully and is reached from the car park in less than one hour. The setting is wild and impressive with some excellent climbing. The Gully is 250m higher than Glendalough crag and so is more prone to cold winds. It shows its magnificence best on a fine day while in dull weather it can provide preparation for the Alps. Unstable or loose blocks are possible, due to the thin, serrated nature of the ridge, and care should always be exercised. Active erosion in the higher reaches of the gully makes descent difficult and unpleasant, particularly in rock boots. An abseil chain has been placed at the top of Great Gully Route. If this is to your satisfaction it will just be possible to reach the gully floor by using two 50m ropes. The climbs are found on the right-hand side when facing up the Gully and are described from the bottom upwards. See the location of the crag at Routes 22 & 45 and location of crag Download topos of the crag at Page 251 FLEETING SUMMER 32m E1 (5b) This route starts at a toe of rock at the bottom right side of the gully, 2m to the right of the Great Gully Route corner. Gain the narrow slab delicately from the left and climb up to a small overhang which is taken on its front face. Move left and up the short grassy corner to a heather ledge beneath an undercut hanging groove. Gain the groove with difficulty and reach up to a horizontal break. Traverse out left onto the steep slab and climb up steeply to reach a narrow foot-ledge at the break. Continue up the centre of the slab and easier blocks beyond to gain a good thread and flake belay on the right side of the ridge. To escape, scramble down to the right. GREAT GULLY RIDGE ** 140m HS (4a,3c,4b,4a) This climb takes a line up the rock ridge which bounds the right-hand side of Great Gully; good clean climbing in a very fine situation. Best enjoyed with not more than 4 people on the route to savour the full flavour. Big groups take away from the experience and the tail-enders can expect to arrive home late. Start in the corner at the bottom right of the gully. (1) 10m Climb the corner to wide crack. Belay under a roof at the top of crack (2) 45m Gain the ridge and follow it directly to large stepping stones and easy ground. (3) 40m Move rightwards up steps and then climb a crack in the right corner of the slab above (crux) or more easily move up right via leaning corners and then back left above the crack. Gain height to a large platform visible from below. (4) 45m Move rightward to a short grassy wall. Move left up this for 3m to the base of a chimney with jammed blocks. Climb these to the top. Pitch not identified by anyone who sought it. It may describe going up via the off-width crack in the variation below. Variation: (4a) Climb a short grassy bank and step up left onto a wide ledge beneath an overhanging off width crack. Move on and down to the end of the ledge (belaying here reduces rope drag) and step up onto a small heathery ledge in a corner. Climb the corner to a ledge and continue up a cracked wall above it. Scramble across the face to a pointed detached block. Finish up the slope behind this. Overview Of Great Gully Ridge Photo: Nick Simons D-FOR-DOG* 18m VS (4b) Start just left of Great Gully corner at the bottom of the obvious clean slab. Climb the arête to the overhang and follow the parallel cracks to the ridge. FLAKE* 15m E1 (5b) Start 15m up on the right side of the gully. Climb broken rock to a grassy ledge beneath the triangular face. Follow the crack-line, trending leftwards to the sharp flake then move rightwards to finish at the boulder on the ridge. THE RAMP 15m VS (4b) Take the steep ramp to the left of the triangular face to the large overhang. Move right to finish. NOT Z BACKWARDS* 25m HVS (5b) Unknown first accent. LET THE HARE SIT 20m VS (4a/4b) From the top of the detached block this route takes the line via the short cracks above it (crux)then up easier ground on good holds to the half way mark. Veer up steeply right on large holds and good friction a meter or so in from the right edge to gain G.G.Ridge. THREE MAD SHEEP (Great Gully) 27m VS (High in the grade) Start on the right hand side of the giant rock pedestal, where the pedestal butts up to the face two meters right of Pauls Crack. Pitch one 22 meters VS. Start at the very wide crack almost like a chimney at the bottom. Climb this all the way as it closes in to form a crack, difficulty increases with height. Athletically finish lay back moves from rounded pulls. Belay on top of grass ledge from nut on face and large block on top of Gully Crack. Pitch two S 5 meters. Step out right and climb wall above on rounded but good friction holds, tending steeply to right. Good belay on ridge. PAUL'S CRACK 18m VS 4b Starts a further 20m up the gully. This route follows the obvious wide crack on the right side of the giant rock pedestal. Z BACKWARDS* 25m VS (4a/4b) Start under the left end of the overhang. Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

Struggle through furze to belay well back on the terrace. ALIENS WAITING ROOM * 22m E1 (5b) This eliminate type slab climb, which has an unprotected crux, starts 2m to the left of the Cyclone Corner crack below a steep narrow slab going up to the left side of an overhang with a holly tree. Climb the delicate slab (avoiding any recourse to the crack) working gradually left towards the top to a small pedestal foothold on the left side of the slab above a heather ledge. Edge back right and pull up on the rounded top edge of the slab to the break just left of the overhang. Continue up the easier slab to the left of the overhang to the terrace. CYCLONE CORNER 52m VS (4c,4a) Start at the bottom right of the buttress at a partly vegetated crack which runs up to an overhang with a holly tree. Nature is reclaiming this route. 1. 22m Climb the crack to the overhang. Move out slightly left onto the steep slab and around the overhang (crux) to a stance. Climb the corner above, which is awkward to start. Belay at the terrace. 2. 30m Start in the middle of the wall (just right of Stone Maiden) about 2m left of the obvious crack. Climb up on small edges passing a diagonal crack to just below a horizontal break. Move out left to a heathery stance. Move up and diagonally right along a crack for about 6m and gain a slabby edge. Follow this to the top The following two climbs start off the higher left-hand level of the offset grassy terrace. PROCTOR'S SLAB 23m S (3c) Gives a good finish to Leftieswell. From the top of Leftieswell climb the centre of the obvious slab on good hidden holds to the top. THE VALLEY WILD 23m HS (4a/b) Start at the right-hand end of the higher terrace at an area of light-coloured quartzy rock. Go up a short curving crack and the short horizontal joints above it to reach the base of a crack. Climb the smooth slab to the left of the crack (crux)to finish. The next four routes start off the lower right-hand grassy terrace. This terrace can be reached by scrambling up the right-hand side of the buttress. GRANISTER 16m S (4a) Start at the left side of the terrace below a dirty corner. Climb up just to the right of a right-trending quartzy crack, to the small overhang. Go straight up over the overhang and belay on a block. STONE MAIDEN 30m S (4a) Start just to the right of Granister. Surmount the slight bulge (thread runner above it), move right and climb up just left of the narrow chimney over short horizontal joints until just level with the top of Granister. Finish up the tiers of rock and vegetation to the right of the arête. SLEEP-WALKER 14m VD Takes the long crack 4m to the right of Stone Maiden which leads up into the narrow chimney on the left side of the small overhang. Bridge up the crack and chimney to the top. TOE THE LINE 15m VS (4b) Start just right of Sleep-Walker and climb up a small ledge and the smooth wall to beneath the right-hand side of the overhang. Up past the break and work out right for 2m on small footholds to gain a short wide crack. Up this to finish. ====GLENMALURE LE BUET==== Immediately above the car park on the Northern slope of the valley is a small sport crag with 4 completed lines. The rock is very compact granite/schist with no natural protection. 4 routes have been equipped. Location: 52°59'21.7\"N 6°24'26.5\"W https://goo.gl/maps/8ugvbBqTAEDQPNb46 From left to right facing the crag: - FROM THE RIVER 12m 6a+ - LE BUET 12m 6b+ - TO THE SEA 15m 6c+ - RIGHT OF RETURN 12m 7a ====BARAVORE VALLEY/ BENLEAGH==== (also known as Fraughan Rock Glen or The Three Valleys or Bolinaskea - Buaile na Sciatha ) is approached by crossing the ford/bridge on the Avonbeg at Baravore turning towards the hostel and after 100m heading up the obvious spur to the left of the old mine building. On reaching the forest road follow it in a generally southwest to west direction until the scree slopes on the right-hand side of the valley come into sight above the forest, more or less directly ahead. Follow a slightly descending section of the track to a sharp left-hand bend,marked on the left by a large boulder, and continue for 100m to the foot of the falling ground. Turn in to the right and skirt some scraggy trees to a moraine which leads up through the forest to steep grass and heather slopes. Above can be seen a prominent gully to the left of The Rock of Baravore -a vegetated wall of rock forming the rim of the valley. This is known to climbers as Great Gully and is reached from the car park in less than one hour. The setting is wild and impressive with some excellent climbing. The Gully is 250m higher than Glendalough crag and so is more prone to cold winds. It shows its magnificence best on a fine day while in dull weather it can provide preparation for the Alps. Unstable or loose blocks are possible, due to the thin, serrated nature of the ridge, and care should always be exercised. Active erosion in the higher reaches of the gully makes descent difficult and unpleasant, particularly in rock boots. An abseil chain has been placed at the top of Great Gully Route. If this is to your satisfaction it will just be possible to reach the gully floor by using two 50m ropes. The climbs are found on the right-hand side when facing up the Gully and are described from the bottom upwards. See the location of the crag at Routes 22 & 45 and location of crag Download topos of the crag at Page 251 FLEETING SUMMER 32m E1 (5b) This route starts at a toe of rock at the bottom right side of the gully, 2m to the right of the Great Gully Route corner. Gain the narrow slab delicately from the left and climb up to a small overhang which is taken on its front face. Move left and up the short grassy corner to a heather ledge beneath an undercut hanging groove. Gain the groove with difficulty and reach up to a horizontal break. Traverse out left onto the steep slab and climb up steeply to reach a narrow foot-ledge at the break. Continue up the centre of the slab and easier blocks beyond to gain a good thread and flake belay on the right side of the ridge. To escape, scramble down to the right. GREAT GULLY RIDGE ** 140m HS (4a,3c,4b,4a) This climb takes a line up the rock ridge which bounds the right-hand side of Great Gully; good clean climbing in a very fine situation. Best enjoyed with not more than 4 people on the route to savour the full flavour. Big groups take away from the experience and the tail-enders can expect to arrive home late. Start in the corner at the bottom right of the gully. (1) 10m Climb the corner to wide crack. Belay under a roof at the top of crack (2) 45m Gain the ridge and follow it directly to large stepping stones and easy ground. (3) 40m Move rightwards up steps and then climb a crack in the right corner of the slab above (crux) or more easily move up right via leaning corners and then back left above the crack. Gain height to a large platform visible from below. (4) 45m Move rightward to a short grassy wall. Move left up this for 3m to the base of a chimney with jammed blocks. Climb these to the top. Pitch not identified by anyone who sought it. It may describe going up via the off-width crack in the variation below. Variation: (4a) Climb a short grassy bank and step up left onto a wide ledge beneath an overhanging off width crack. Move on and down to the end of the ledge (belaying here reduces rope drag) and step up onto a small heathery ledge in a corner. Climb the corner to a ledge and continue up a cracked wall above it. Scramble across the face to a pointed detached block. Finish up the slope behind this. Overview Of Great Gully Ridge Photo: Nick Simons D-FOR-DOG* 18m VS (4b) Start just left of Great Gully corner at the bottom of the obvious clean slab. Climb the arête to the overhang and follow the parallel cracks to the ridge. FLAKE* 15m E1 (5b) Start 15m up on the right side of the gully. Climb broken rock to a grassy ledge beneath the triangular face. Follow the crack-line, trending leftwards to the sharp flake then move rightwards to finish at the boulder on the ridge. THE RAMP 15m VS (4b) Take the steep ramp to the left of the triangular face to the large overhang. Move right to finish. NOT Z BACKWARDS* 25m HVS (5b) Unknown first accent. LET THE HARE SIT 20m VS (4a/4b) From the top of the detached block this route takes the line via the short cracks above it (crux)then up easier ground on good holds to the half way mark. Veer up steeply right on large holds and good friction a meter or so in from the right edge to gain G.G.Ridge. THREE MAD SHEEP (Great Gully) 27m VS (High in the grade) Start on the right hand side of the giant rock pedestal, where the pedestal butts up to the face two meters right of Pauls Crack. Pitch one 22 meters VS. Start at the very wide crack almost like a chimney at the bottom. Climb this all the way as it closes in to form a crack, difficulty increases with height. Athletically finish lay back moves from rounded pulls. Belay on top of grass ledge from nut on face and large block on top of Gully Crack. Pitch two S 5 meters. Step out right and climb wall above on rounded but good friction holds, tending steeply to right. Good belay on ridge. PAUL'S CRACK 18m VS 4b Starts a further 20m up the gully. This route follows the obvious wide crack on the right side of the giant rock pedestal. Z BACKWARDS* 25m VS (4a/4b) Start under the left end of the overhang. Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

Struggle through furze to belay well back on the terrace. ALIENS WAITING ROOM * 22m E1 (5b) This eliminate type slab climb, which has an unprotected crux, starts 2m to the left of the Cyclone Corner crack below a steep narrow slab going up to the left side of an overhang with a holly tree. Climb the delicate slab (avoiding any recourse to the crack) working gradually left towards the top to a small pedestal foothold on the left side of the slab above a heather ledge. Edge back right and pull up on the rounded top edge of the slab to the break just left of the overhang. Continue up the easier slab to the left of the overhang to the terrace. CYCLONE CORNER 52m VS (4c,4a) Start at the bottom right of the buttress at a partly vegetated crack which runs up to an overhang with a holly tree. Nature is reclaiming this route. 1. 22m Climb the crack to the overhang. Move out slightly left onto the steep slab and around the overhang (crux) to a stance. Climb the corner above, which is awkward to start. Belay at the terrace. 2. 30m Start in the middle of the wall (just right of Stone Maiden) about 2m left of the obvious crack. Climb up on small edges passing a diagonal crack to just below a horizontal break. Move out left to a heathery stance. Move up and diagonally right along a crack for about 6m and gain a slabby edge. Follow this to the top The following two climbs start off the higher left-hand level of the offset grassy terrace. PROCTOR'S SLAB 23m S (3c) Gives a good finish to Leftieswell. From the top of Leftieswell climb the centre of the obvious slab on good hidden holds to the top. THE VALLEY WILD 23m HS (4a/b) Start at the right-hand end of the higher terrace at an area of light-coloured quartzy rock. Go up a short curving crack and the short horizontal joints above it to reach the base of a crack. Climb the smooth slab to the left of the crack (crux)to finish. The next four routes start off the lower right-hand grassy terrace. This terrace can be reached by scrambling up the right-hand side of the buttress. GRANISTER 16m S (4a) Start at the left side of the terrace below a dirty corner. Climb up just to the right of a right-trending quartzy crack, to the small overhang. Go straight up over the overhang and belay on a block. STONE MAIDEN 30m S (4a) Start just to the right of Granister. Surmount the slight bulge (thread runner above it), move right and climb up just left of the narrow chimney over short horizontal joints until just level with the top of Granister. Finish up the tiers of rock and vegetation to the right of the arête. SLEEP-WALKER 14m VD Takes the long crack 4m to the right of Stone Maiden which leads up into the narrow chimney on the left side of the small overhang. Bridge up the crack and chimney to the top. TOE THE LINE 15m VS (4b) Start just right of Sleep-Walker and climb up a small ledge and the smooth wall to beneath the right-hand side of the overhang. Up past the break and work out right for 2m on small footholds to gain a short wide crack. Up this to finish. ====GLENMALURE LE BUET==== Immediately above the car park on the Northern slope of the valley is a small sport crag with 4 completed lines. The rock is very compact granite/schist with no natural protection. 4 routes have been equipped. Location: 52°59'21.7\"N 6°24'26.5\"W https://goo.gl/maps/8ugvbBqTAEDQPNb46 From left to right facing the crag: - FROM THE RIVER 12m 6a+ - LE BUET 12m 6b+ - TO THE SEA 15m 6c+ - RIGHT OF RETURN 12m 7a ====BARAVORE VALLEY/ BENLEAGH==== (also known as Fraughan Rock Glen or The Three Valleys or Bolinaskea - Buaile na Sciatha ) is approached by crossing the ford/bridge on the Avonbeg at Baravore turning towards the hostel and after 100m heading up the obvious spur to the left of the old mine building. On reaching the forest road follow it in a generally southwest to west direction until the scree slopes on the right-hand side of the valley come into sight above the forest, more or less directly ahead. Follow a slightly descending section of the track to a sharp left-hand bend,marked on the left by a large boulder, and continue for 100m to the foot of the falling ground. Turn in to the right and skirt some scraggy trees to a moraine which leads up through the forest to steep grass and heather slopes. Above can be seen a prominent gully to the left of The Rock of Baravore -a vegetated wall of rock forming the rim of the valley. This is known to climbers as Great Gully and is reached from the car park in less than one hour. The setting is wild and impressive with some excellent climbing. The Gully is 250m higher than Glendalough crag and so is more prone to cold winds. It shows its magnificence best on a fine day while in dull weather it can provide preparation for the Alps. Unstable or loose blocks are possible, due to the thin, serrated nature of the ridge, and care should always be exercised. Active erosion in the higher reaches of the gully makes descent difficult and unpleasant, particularly in rock boots. An abseil chain has been placed at the top of Great Gully Route. If this is to your satisfaction it will just be possible to reach the gully floor by using two 50m ropes. The climbs are found on the right-hand side when facing up the Gully and are described from the bottom upwards. See the location of the crag at Routes 22 & 45 and location of crag Download topos of the crag at Page 251 FLEETING SUMMER 32m E1 (5b) This route starts at a toe of rock at the bottom right side of the gully, 2m to the right of the Great Gully Route corner. Gain the narrow slab delicately from the left and climb up to a small overhang which is taken on its front face. Move left and up the short grassy corner to a heather ledge beneath an undercut hanging groove. Gain the groove with difficulty and reach up to a horizontal break. Traverse out left onto the steep slab and climb up steeply to reach a narrow foot-ledge at the break. Continue up the centre of the slab and easier blocks beyond to gain a good thread and flake belay on the right side of the ridge. To escape, scramble down to the right. GREAT GULLY RIDGE ** 140m HS (4a,3c,4b,4a) This climb takes a line up the rock ridge which bounds the right-hand side of Great Gully; good clean climbing in a very fine situation. Best enjoyed with not more than 4 people on the route to savour the full flavour. Big groups take away from the experience and the tail-enders can expect to arrive home late. Start in the corner at the bottom right of the gully. (1) 10m Climb the corner to wide crack. Belay under a roof at the top of crack (2) 45m Gain the ridge and follow it directly to large stepping stones and easy ground. (3) 40m Move rightwards up steps and then climb a crack in the right corner of the slab above (crux) or more easily move up right via leaning corners and then back left above the crack. Gain height to a large platform visible from below. (4) 45m Move rightward to a short grassy wall. Move left up this for 3m to the base of a chimney with jammed blocks. Climb these to the top. Pitch not identified by anyone who sought it. It may describe going up via the off-width crack in the variation below. Variation: (4a) Climb a short grassy bank and step up left onto a wide ledge beneath an overhanging off width crack. Move on and down to the end of the ledge (belaying here reduces rope drag) and step up onto a small heathery ledge in a corner. Climb the corner to a ledge and continue up a cracked wall above it. Scramble across the face to a pointed detached block. Finish up the slope behind this. Overview Of Great Gully Ridge Photo: Nick Simons D-FOR-DOG* 18m VS (4b) Start just left of Great Gully corner at the bottom of the obvious clean slab. Climb the arête to the overhang and follow the parallel cracks to the ridge. FLAKE* 15m E1 (5b) Start 15m up on the right side of the gully. Climb broken rock to a grassy ledge beneath the triangular face. Follow the crack-line, trending leftwards to the sharp flake then move rightwards to finish at the boulder on the ridge. THE RAMP 15m VS (4b) Take the steep ramp to the left of the triangular face to the large overhang. Move right to finish. NOT Z BACKWARDS* 25m HVS (5b) Unknown first accent. LET THE HARE SIT 20m VS (4a/4b) From the top of the detached block this route takes the line via the short cracks above it (crux)then up easier ground on good holds to the half way mark. Veer up steeply right on large holds and good friction a meter or so in from the right edge to gain G.G.Ridge. THREE MAD SHEEP (Great Gully) 27m VS (High in the grade) Start on the right hand side of the giant rock pedestal, where the pedestal butts up to the face two meters right of Pauls Crack. Pitch one 22 meters VS. Start at the very wide crack almost like a chimney at the bottom. Climb this all the way as it closes in to form a crack, difficulty increases with height. Athletically finish lay back moves from rounded pulls. Belay on top of grass ledge from nut on face and large block on top of Gully Crack. Pitch two S 5 meters. Step out right and climb wall above on rounded but good friction holds, tending steeply to right. Good belay on ridge. PAUL'S CRACK 18m VS 4b Starts a further 20m up the gully. This route follows the obvious wide crack on the right side of the giant rock pedestal. Z BACKWARDS* 25m VS (4a/4b) Start under the left end of the overhang. Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

Struggle through furze to belay well back on the terrace. ALIENS WAITING ROOM * 22m E1 (5b) This eliminate type slab climb, which has an unprotected crux, starts 2m to the left of the Cyclone Corner crack below a steep narrow slab going up to the left side of an overhang with a holly tree. Climb the delicate slab (avoiding any recourse to the crack) working gradually left towards the top to a small pedestal foothold on the left side of the slab above a heather ledge. Edge back right and pull up on the rounded top edge of the slab to the break just left of the overhang. Continue up the easier slab to the left of the overhang to the terrace. CYCLONE CORNER 52m VS (4c,4a) Start at the bottom right of the buttress at a partly vegetated crack which runs up to an overhang with a holly tree. Nature is reclaiming this route. 1. 22m Climb the crack to the overhang. Move out slightly left onto the steep slab and around the overhang (crux) to a stance. Climb the corner above, which is awkward to start. Belay at the terrace. 2. 30m Start in the middle of the wall (just right of Stone Maiden) about 2m left of the obvious crack. Climb up on small edges passing a diagonal crack to just below a horizontal break. Move out left to a heathery stance. Move up and diagonally right along a crack for about 6m and gain a slabby edge. Follow this to the top The following two climbs start off the higher left-hand level of the offset grassy terrace. PROCTOR'S SLAB 23m S (3c) Gives a good finish to Leftieswell. From the top of Leftieswell climb the centre of the obvious slab on good hidden holds to the top. THE VALLEY WILD 23m HS (4a/b) Start at the right-hand end of the higher terrace at an area of light-coloured quartzy rock. Go up a short curving crack and the short horizontal joints above it to reach the base of a crack. Climb the smooth slab to the left of the crack (crux)to finish. The next four routes start off the lower right-hand grassy terrace. This terrace can be reached by scrambling up the right-hand side of the buttress. GRANISTER 16m S (4a) Start at the left side of the terrace below a dirty corner. Climb up just to the right of a right-trending quartzy crack, to the small overhang. Go straight up over the overhang and belay on a block. STONE MAIDEN 30m S (4a) Start just to the right of Granister. Surmount the slight bulge (thread runner above it), move right and climb up just left of the narrow chimney over short horizontal joints until just level with the top of Granister. Finish up the tiers of rock and vegetation to the right of the arête. SLEEP-WALKER 14m VD Takes the long crack 4m to the right of Stone Maiden which leads up into the narrow chimney on the left side of the small overhang. Bridge up the crack and chimney to the top. TOE THE LINE 15m VS (4b) Start just right of Sleep-Walker and climb up a small ledge and the smooth wall to beneath the right-hand side of the overhang. Up past the break and work out right for 2m on small footholds to gain a short wide crack. Up this to finish. ====GLENMALURE LE BUET==== Immediately above the car park on the Northern slope of the valley is a small sport crag with 4 completed lines. The rock is very compact granite/schist with no natural protection. 4 routes have been equipped. Location: 52°59'21.7\"N 6°24'26.5\"W https://goo.gl/maps/8ugvbBqTAEDQPNb46 From left to right facing the crag: - FROM THE RIVER 12m 6a+ - LE BUET 12m 6b+ - TO THE SEA 15m 6c+ - RIGHT OF RETURN 12m 7a ====BARAVORE VALLEY/ BENLEAGH==== (also known as Fraughan Rock Glen or The Three Valleys or Bolinaskea - Buaile na Sciatha ) is approached by crossing the ford/bridge on the Avonbeg at Baravore turning towards the hostel and after 100m heading up the obvious spur to the left of the old mine building. On reaching the forest road follow it in a generally southwest to west direction until the scree slopes on the right-hand side of the valley come into sight above the forest, more or less directly ahead. Follow a slightly descending section of the track to a sharp left-hand bend,marked on the left by a large boulder, and continue for 100m to the foot of the falling ground. Turn in to the right and skirt some scraggy trees to a moraine which leads up through the forest to steep grass and heather slopes. Above can be seen a prominent gully to the left of The Rock of Baravore -a vegetated wall of rock forming the rim of the valley. This is known to climbers as Great Gully and is reached from the car park in less than one hour. The setting is wild and impressive with some excellent climbing. The Gully is 250m higher than Glendalough crag and so is more prone to cold winds. It shows its magnificence best on a fine day while in dull weather it can provide preparation for the Alps. Unstable or loose blocks are possible, due to the thin, serrated nature of the ridge, and care should always be exercised. Active erosion in the higher reaches of the gully makes descent difficult and unpleasant, particularly in rock boots. An abseil chain has been placed at the top of Great Gully Route. If this is to your satisfaction it will just be possible to reach the gully floor by using two 50m ropes. The climbs are found on the right-hand side when facing up the Gully and are described from the bottom upwards. See the location of the crag at Routes 22 & 45 and location of crag Download topos of the crag at Page 251 FLEETING SUMMER 32m E1 (5b) This route starts at a toe of rock at the bottom right side of the gully, 2m to the right of the Great Gully Route corner. Gain the narrow slab delicately from the left and climb up to a small overhang which is taken on its front face. Move left and up the short grassy corner to a heather ledge beneath an undercut hanging groove. Gain the groove with difficulty and reach up to a horizontal break. Traverse out left onto the steep slab and climb up steeply to reach a narrow foot-ledge at the break. Continue up the centre of the slab and easier blocks beyond to gain a good thread and flake belay on the right side of the ridge. To escape, scramble down to the right. GREAT GULLY RIDGE ** 140m HS (4a,3c,4b,4a) This climb takes a line up the rock ridge which bounds the right-hand side of Great Gully; good clean climbing in a very fine situation. Best enjoyed with not more than 4 people on the route to savour the full flavour. Big groups take away from the experience and the tail-enders can expect to arrive home late. Start in the corner at the bottom right of the gully. (1) 10m Climb the corner to wide crack. Belay under a roof at the top of crack (2) 45m Gain the ridge and follow it directly to large stepping stones and easy ground. (3) 40m Move rightwards up steps and then climb a crack in the right corner of the slab above (crux) or more easily move up right via leaning corners and then back left above the crack. Gain height to a large platform visible from below. (4) 45m Move rightward to a short grassy wall. Move left up this for 3m to the base of a chimney with jammed blocks. Climb these to the top. Pitch not identified by anyone who sought it. It may describe going up via the off-width crack in the variation below. Variation: (4a) Climb a short grassy bank and step up left onto a wide ledge beneath an overhanging off width crack. Move on and down to the end of the ledge (belaying here reduces rope drag) and step up onto a small heathery ledge in a corner. Climb the corner to a ledge and continue up a cracked wall above it. Scramble across the face to a pointed detached block. Finish up the slope behind this. Overview Of Great Gully Ridge Photo: Nick Simons D-FOR-DOG* 18m VS (4b) Start just left of Great Gully corner at the bottom of the obvious clean slab. Climb the arête to the overhang and follow the parallel cracks to the ridge. FLAKE* 15m E1 (5b) Start 15m up on the right side of the gully. Climb broken rock to a grassy ledge beneath the triangular face. Follow the crack-line, trending leftwards to the sharp flake then move rightwards to finish at the boulder on the ridge. THE RAMP 15m VS (4b) Take the steep ramp to the left of the triangular face to the large overhang. Move right to finish. NOT Z BACKWARDS* 25m HVS (5b) Unknown first accent. LET THE HARE SIT 20m VS (4a/4b) From the top of the detached block this route takes the line via the short cracks above it (crux)then up easier ground on good holds to the half way mark. Veer up steeply right on large holds and good friction a meter or so in from the right edge to gain G.G.Ridge. THREE MAD SHEEP (Great Gully) 27m VS (High in the grade) Start on the right hand side of the giant rock pedestal, where the pedestal butts up to the face two meters right of Pauls Crack. Pitch one 22 meters VS. Start at the very wide crack almost like a chimney at the bottom. Climb this all the way as it closes in to form a crack, difficulty increases with height. Athletically finish lay back moves from rounded pulls. Belay on top of grass ledge from nut on face and large block on top of Gully Crack. Pitch two S 5 meters. Step out right and climb wall above on rounded but good friction holds, tending steeply to right. Good belay on ridge. PAUL'S CRACK 18m VS 4b Starts a further 20m up the gully. This route follows the obvious wide crack on the right side of the giant rock pedestal. Z BACKWARDS* 25m VS (4a/4b) Start under the left end of the overhang. Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

Traverse right beneath this for several metres to the base of an arête forming the left wall of the obvious chimney. Move up and gain the slab above on the left side of the exposed arête. Make delicate balance moves up along the arête towards easier ground and the finish. LEFTIESWELL * 27m S (4a) Start on the right side of the buttress, right of the holly tree, under and slightly left of the obvious chimney at half-height. 1. 18m Climb the slab, trending right to the base of the chimney. Climb the right wall of the chimney to a grassy terrace and belay. 2. 9m Crux pitch. Go straight up from the top of the chimney which narrows to a crack with two awkward moves. Belay well back. Download topos of the next 3 routes at Glenmalure North 4 Also download topos of the next 5 routes at Glenmalure North full ANTICYCLONE 25m HS (4b) Start just right of Leftieswell about 8m right of the holly tree and at a right-trending quartz crack. 1. 15m Follow the thin knobby quartz line up to the ledge, continue up left of loose blocks to another ledge and then go diagonally right to finish at the belay ledge. 2. 10m Climb out left and go up the slab to the Leftieswell chimney; finish up just right of the chimney via the slab. Struggle through furze to belay well back on the terrace. ALIENS WAITING ROOM * 22m E1 (5b) This eliminate type slab climb, which has an unprotected crux, starts 2m to the left of the Cyclone Corner crack below a steep narrow slab going up to the left side of an overhang with a holly tree. Climb the delicate slab (avoiding any recourse to the crack) working gradually left towards the top to a small pedestal foothold on the left side of the slab above a heather ledge. Edge back right and pull up on the rounded top edge of the slab to the break just left of the overhang. Continue up the easier slab to the left of the overhang to the terrace. CYCLONE CORNER 52m VS (4c,4a) Start at the bottom right of the buttress at a partly vegetated crack which runs up to an overhang with a holly tree. Nature is reclaiming this route. 1. 22m Climb the crack to the overhang. Move out slightly left onto the steep slab and around the overhang (crux) to a stance. Climb the corner above, which is awkward to start. Belay at the terrace. 2. 30m Start in the middle of the wall (just right of Stone Maiden) about 2m left of the obvious crack. Climb up on small edges passing a diagonal crack to just below a horizontal break. Move out left to a heathery stance. Move up and diagonally right along a crack for about 6m and gain a slabby edge. Follow this to the top The following two climbs start off the higher left-hand level of the offset grassy terrace. PROCTOR'S SLAB 23m S (3c) Gives a good finish to Leftieswell. From the top of Leftieswell climb the centre of the obvious slab on good hidden holds to the top. THE VALLEY WILD 23m HS (4a/b) Start at the right-hand end of the higher terrace at an area of light-coloured quartzy rock. Go up a short curving crack and the short horizontal joints above it to reach the base of a crack. Climb the smooth slab to the left of the crack (crux)to finish. The next four routes start off the lower right-hand grassy terrace. This terrace can be reached by scrambling up the right-hand side of the buttress. GRANISTER 16m S (4a) Start at the left side of the terrace below a dirty corner. Climb up just to the right of a right-trending quartzy crack, to the small overhang. Go straight up over the overhang and belay on a block. STONE MAIDEN 30m S (4a) Start just to the right of Granister. Surmount the slight bulge (thread runner above it), move right and climb up just left of the narrow chimney over short horizontal joints until just level with the top of Granister. Finish up the tiers of rock and vegetation to the right of the arête. SLEEP-WALKER 14m VD Takes the long crack 4m to the right of Stone Maiden which leads up into the narrow chimney on the left side of the small overhang. Bridge up the crack and chimney to the top. TOE THE LINE 15m VS (4b) Start just right of Sleep-Walker and climb up a small ledge and the smooth wall to beneath the right-hand side of the overhang. Up past the break and work out right for 2m on small footholds to gain a short wide crack. Up this to finish. ====GLENMALURE LE BUET==== Immediately above the car park on the Northern slope of the valley is a small sport crag with 4 completed lines. The rock is very compact granite/schist with no natural protection. 4 routes have been equipped. Location: 52°59'21.7\"N 6°24'26.5\"W https://goo.gl/maps/8ugvbBqTAEDQPNb46 From left to right facing the crag: - FROM THE RIVER 12m 6a+ - LE BUET 12m 6b+ - TO THE SEA 15m 6c+ - RIGHT OF RETURN 12m 7a ====BARAVORE VALLEY/ BENLEAGH==== (also known as Fraughan Rock Glen or The Three Valleys or Bolinaskea - Buaile na Sciatha ) is approached by crossing the ford/bridge on the Avonbeg at Baravore turning towards the hostel and after 100m heading up the obvious spur to the left of the old mine building. On reaching the forest road follow it in a generally southwest to west direction until the scree slopes on the right-hand side of the valley come into sight above the forest, more or less directly ahead. Follow a slightly descending section of the track to a sharp left-hand bend,marked on the left by a large boulder, and continue for 100m to the foot of the falling ground. Turn in to the right and skirt some scraggy trees to a moraine which leads up through the forest to steep grass and heather slopes. Above can be seen a prominent gully to the left of The Rock of Baravore -a vegetated wall of rock forming the rim of the valley. This is known to climbers as Great Gully and is reached from the car park in less than one hour. The setting is wild and impressive with some excellent climbing. The Gully is 250m higher than Glendalough crag and so is more prone to cold winds. It shows its magnificence best on a fine day while in dull weather it can provide preparation for the Alps. Unstable or loose blocks are possible, due to the thin, serrated nature of the ridge, and care should always be exercised. Active erosion in the higher reaches of the gully makes descent difficult and unpleasant, particularly in rock boots. An abseil chain has been placed at the top of Great Gully Route. If this is to your satisfaction it will just be possible to reach the gully floor by using two 50m ropes. The climbs are found on the right-hand side when facing up the Gully and are described from the bottom upwards. See the location of the crag at Routes 22 & 45 and location of crag Download topos of the crag at Page 251 FLEETING SUMMER 32m E1 (5b) This route starts at a toe of rock at the bottom right side of the gully, 2m to the right of the Great Gully Route corner. Gain the narrow slab delicately from the left and climb up to a small overhang which is taken on its front face. Move left and up the short grassy corner to a heather ledge beneath an undercut hanging groove. Gain the groove with difficulty and reach up to a horizontal break. Traverse out left onto the steep slab and climb up steeply to reach a narrow foot-ledge at the break. Continue up the centre of the slab and easier blocks beyond to gain a good thread and flake belay on the right side of the ridge. To escape, scramble down to the right. GREAT GULLY RIDGE ** 140m HS (4a,3c,4b,4a) This climb takes a line up the rock ridge which bounds the right-hand side of Great Gully; good clean climbing in a very fine situation. Best enjoyed with not more than 4 people on the route to savour the full flavour. Big groups take away from the experience and the tail-enders can expect to arrive home late. Start in the corner at the bottom right of the gully. (1) 10m Climb the corner to wide crack. Belay under a roof at the top of crack (2) 45m Gain the ridge and follow it directly to large stepping stones and easy ground. (3) 40m Move rightwards up steps and then climb a crack in the right corner of the slab above (crux) or more easily move up right via leaning corners and then back left above the crack. Gain height to a large platform visible from below. (4) 45m Move rightward to a short grassy wall. Move left up this for 3m to the base of a chimney with jammed blocks. Climb these to the top. Pitch not identified by anyone who sought it. It may describe going up via the off-width crack in the variation below. Variation: (4a) Climb a short grassy bank and step up left onto a wide ledge beneath an overhanging off width crack. Move on and down to the end of the ledge (belaying here reduces rope drag) and step up onto a small heathery ledge in a corner. Climb the corner to a ledge and continue up a cracked wall above it. Scramble across the face to a pointed detached block. Finish up the slope behind this. Overview Of Great Gully Ridge Photo: Nick Simons D-FOR-DOG* 18m VS (4b) Start just left of Great Gully corner at the bottom of the obvious clean slab. Climb the arête to the overhang and follow the parallel cracks to the ridge. FLAKE* 15m E1 (5b) Start 15m up on the right side of the gully. Climb broken rock to a grassy ledge beneath the triangular face. Follow the crack-line, trending leftwards to the sharp flake then move rightwards to finish at the boulder on the ridge. THE RAMP 15m VS (4b) Take the steep ramp to the left of the triangular face to the large overhang. Move right to finish. NOT Z BACKWARDS* 25m HVS (5b) Unknown first accent. LET THE HARE SIT 20m VS (4a/4b) From the top of the detached block this route takes the line via the short cracks above it (crux)then up easier ground on good holds to the half way mark. Veer up steeply right on large holds and good friction a meter or so in from the right edge to gain G.G.Ridge. THREE MAD SHEEP (Great Gully) 27m VS (High in the grade) Start on the right hand side of the giant rock pedestal, where the pedestal butts up to the face two meters right of Pauls Crack. Pitch one 22 meters VS. Start at the very wide crack almost like a chimney at the bottom. Climb this all the way as it closes in to form a crack, difficulty increases with height. Athletically finish lay back moves from rounded pulls. Belay on top of grass ledge from nut on face and large block on top of Gully Crack. Pitch two S 5 meters. Step out right and climb wall above on rounded but good friction holds, tending steeply to right. Good belay on ridge. PAUL'S CRACK 18m VS 4b Starts a further 20m up the gully. This route follows the obvious wide crack on the right side of the giant rock pedestal. Z BACKWARDS* 25m VS (4a/4b) Start under the left end of the overhang. Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

Climb the right wall of the chimney to a grassy terrace and belay. 2. 9m Crux pitch. Go straight up from the top of the chimney which narrows to a crack with two awkward moves. Belay well back. Download topos of the next 3 routes at Glenmalure North 4 Also download topos of the next 5 routes at Glenmalure North full ANTICYCLONE 25m HS (4b) Start just right of Leftieswell about 8m right of the holly tree and at a right-trending quartz crack. 1. 15m Follow the thin knobby quartz line up to the ledge, continue up left of loose blocks to another ledge and then go diagonally right to finish at the belay ledge. 2. 10m Climb out left and go up the slab to the Leftieswell chimney; finish up just right of the chimney via the slab. Struggle through furze to belay well back on the terrace. ALIENS WAITING ROOM * 22m E1 (5b) This eliminate type slab climb, which has an unprotected crux, starts 2m to the left of the Cyclone Corner crack below a steep narrow slab going up to the left side of an overhang with a holly tree. Climb the delicate slab (avoiding any recourse to the crack) working gradually left towards the top to a small pedestal foothold on the left side of the slab above a heather ledge. Edge back right and pull up on the rounded top edge of the slab to the break just left of the overhang. Continue up the easier slab to the left of the overhang to the terrace. CYCLONE CORNER 52m VS (4c,4a) Start at the bottom right of the buttress at a partly vegetated crack which runs up to an overhang with a holly tree. Nature is reclaiming this route. 1. 22m Climb the crack to the overhang. Move out slightly left onto the steep slab and around the overhang (crux) to a stance. Climb the corner above, which is awkward to start. Belay at the terrace. 2. 30m Start in the middle of the wall (just right of Stone Maiden) about 2m left of the obvious crack. Climb up on small edges passing a diagonal crack to just below a horizontal break. Move out left to a heathery stance. Move up and diagonally right along a crack for about 6m and gain a slabby edge. Follow this to the top The following two climbs start off the higher left-hand level of the offset grassy terrace. PROCTOR'S SLAB 23m S (3c) Gives a good finish to Leftieswell. From the top of Leftieswell climb the centre of the obvious slab on good hidden holds to the top. THE VALLEY WILD 23m HS (4a/b) Start at the right-hand end of the higher terrace at an area of light-coloured quartzy rock. Go up a short curving crack and the short horizontal joints above it to reach the base of a crack. Climb the smooth slab to the left of the crack (crux)to finish. The next four routes start off the lower right-hand grassy terrace. This terrace can be reached by scrambling up the right-hand side of the buttress. GRANISTER 16m S (4a) Start at the left side of the terrace below a dirty corner. Climb up just to the right of a right-trending quartzy crack, to the small overhang. Go straight up over the overhang and belay on a block. STONE MAIDEN 30m S (4a) Start just to the right of Granister. Surmount the slight bulge (thread runner above it), move right and climb up just left of the narrow chimney over short horizontal joints until just level with the top of Granister. Finish up the tiers of rock and vegetation to the right of the arête. SLEEP-WALKER 14m VD Takes the long crack 4m to the right of Stone Maiden which leads up into the narrow chimney on the left side of the small overhang. Bridge up the crack and chimney to the top. TOE THE LINE 15m VS (4b) Start just right of Sleep-Walker and climb up a small ledge and the smooth wall to beneath the right-hand side of the overhang. Up past the break and work out right for 2m on small footholds to gain a short wide crack. Up this to finish. ====GLENMALURE LE BUET==== Immediately above the car park on the Northern slope of the valley is a small sport crag with 4 completed lines. The rock is very compact granite/schist with no natural protection. 4 routes have been equipped. Location: 52°59'21.7\"N 6°24'26.5\"W https://goo.gl/maps/8ugvbBqTAEDQPNb46 From left to right facing the crag: - FROM THE RIVER 12m 6a+ - LE BUET 12m 6b+ - TO THE SEA 15m 6c+ - RIGHT OF RETURN 12m 7a ====BARAVORE VALLEY/ BENLEAGH==== (also known as Fraughan Rock Glen or The Three Valleys or Bolinaskea - Buaile na Sciatha ) is approached by crossing the ford/bridge on the Avonbeg at Baravore turning towards the hostel and after 100m heading up the obvious spur to the left of the old mine building. On reaching the forest road follow it in a generally southwest to west direction until the scree slopes on the right-hand side of the valley come into sight above the forest, more or less directly ahead. Follow a slightly descending section of the track to a sharp left-hand bend,marked on the left by a large boulder, and continue for 100m to the foot of the falling ground. Turn in to the right and skirt some scraggy trees to a moraine which leads up through the forest to steep grass and heather slopes. Above can be seen a prominent gully to the left of The Rock of Baravore -a vegetated wall of rock forming the rim of the valley. This is known to climbers as Great Gully and is reached from the car park in less than one hour. The setting is wild and impressive with some excellent climbing. The Gully is 250m higher than Glendalough crag and so is more prone to cold winds. It shows its magnificence best on a fine day while in dull weather it can provide preparation for the Alps. Unstable or loose blocks are possible, due to the thin, serrated nature of the ridge, and care should always be exercised. Active erosion in the higher reaches of the gully makes descent difficult and unpleasant, particularly in rock boots. An abseil chain has been placed at the top of Great Gully Route. If this is to your satisfaction it will just be possible to reach the gully floor by using two 50m ropes. The climbs are found on the right-hand side when facing up the Gully and are described from the bottom upwards. See the location of the crag at Routes 22 & 45 and location of crag Download topos of the crag at Page 251 FLEETING SUMMER 32m E1 (5b) This route starts at a toe of rock at the bottom right side of the gully, 2m to the right of the Great Gully Route corner. Gain the narrow slab delicately from the left and climb up to a small overhang which is taken on its front face. Move left and up the short grassy corner to a heather ledge beneath an undercut hanging groove. Gain the groove with difficulty and reach up to a horizontal break. Traverse out left onto the steep slab and climb up steeply to reach a narrow foot-ledge at the break. Continue up the centre of the slab and easier blocks beyond to gain a good thread and flake belay on the right side of the ridge. To escape, scramble down to the right. GREAT GULLY RIDGE ** 140m HS (4a,3c,4b,4a) This climb takes a line up the rock ridge which bounds the right-hand side of Great Gully; good clean climbing in a very fine situation. Best enjoyed with not more than 4 people on the route to savour the full flavour. Big groups take away from the experience and the tail-enders can expect to arrive home late. Start in the corner at the bottom right of the gully. (1) 10m Climb the corner to wide crack. Belay under a roof at the top of crack (2) 45m Gain the ridge and follow it directly to large stepping stones and easy ground. (3) 40m Move rightwards up steps and then climb a crack in the right corner of the slab above (crux) or more easily move up right via leaning corners and then back left above the crack. Gain height to a large platform visible from below. (4) 45m Move rightward to a short grassy wall. Move left up this for 3m to the base of a chimney with jammed blocks. Climb these to the top. Pitch not identified by anyone who sought it. It may describe going up via the off-width crack in the variation below. Variation: (4a) Climb a short grassy bank and step up left onto a wide ledge beneath an overhanging off width crack. Move on and down to the end of the ledge (belaying here reduces rope drag) and step up onto a small heathery ledge in a corner. Climb the corner to a ledge and continue up a cracked wall above it. Scramble across the face to a pointed detached block. Finish up the slope behind this. Overview Of Great Gully Ridge Photo: Nick Simons D-FOR-DOG* 18m VS (4b) Start just left of Great Gully corner at the bottom of the obvious clean slab. Climb the arête to the overhang and follow the parallel cracks to the ridge. FLAKE* 15m E1 (5b) Start 15m up on the right side of the gully. Climb broken rock to a grassy ledge beneath the triangular face. Follow the crack-line, trending leftwards to the sharp flake then move rightwards to finish at the boulder on the ridge. THE RAMP 15m VS (4b) Take the steep ramp to the left of the triangular face to the large overhang. Move right to finish. NOT Z BACKWARDS* 25m HVS (5b) Unknown first accent. LET THE HARE SIT 20m VS (4a/4b) From the top of the detached block this route takes the line via the short cracks above it (crux)then up easier ground on good holds to the half way mark. Veer up steeply right on large holds and good friction a meter or so in from the right edge to gain G.G.Ridge. THREE MAD SHEEP (Great Gully) 27m VS (High in the grade) Start on the right hand side of the giant rock pedestal, where the pedestal butts up to the face two meters right of Pauls Crack. Pitch one 22 meters VS. Start at the very wide crack almost like a chimney at the bottom. Climb this all the way as it closes in to form a crack, difficulty increases with height. Athletically finish lay back moves from rounded pulls. Belay on top of grass ledge from nut on face and large block on top of Gully Crack. Pitch two S 5 meters. Step out right and climb wall above on rounded but good friction holds, tending steeply to right. Good belay on ridge. PAUL'S CRACK 18m VS 4b Starts a further 20m up the gully. This route follows the obvious wide crack on the right side of the giant rock pedestal. Z BACKWARDS* 25m VS (4a/4b) Start under the left end of the overhang. Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

Struggle through furze to belay well back on the terrace. ALIENS WAITING ROOM * 22m E1 (5b) This eliminate type slab climb, which has an unprotected crux, starts 2m to the left of the Cyclone Corner crack below a steep narrow slab going up to the left side of an overhang with a holly tree. Climb the delicate slab (avoiding any recourse to the crack) working gradually left towards the top to a small pedestal foothold on the left side of the slab above a heather ledge. Edge back right and pull up on the rounded top edge of the slab to the break just left of the overhang. Continue up the easier slab to the left of the overhang to the terrace. CYCLONE CORNER 52m VS (4c,4a) Start at the bottom right of the buttress at a partly vegetated crack which runs up to an overhang with a holly tree. Nature is reclaiming this route. 1. 22m Climb the crack to the overhang. Move out slightly left onto the steep slab and around the overhang (crux) to a stance. Climb the corner above, which is awkward to start. Belay at the terrace. 2. 30m Start in the middle of the wall (just right of Stone Maiden) about 2m left of the obvious crack. Climb up on small edges passing a diagonal crack to just below a horizontal break. Move out left to a heathery stance. Move up and diagonally right along a crack for about 6m and gain a slabby edge. Follow this to the top The following two climbs start off the higher left-hand level of the offset grassy terrace. PROCTOR'S SLAB 23m S (3c) Gives a good finish to Leftieswell. From the top of Leftieswell climb the centre of the obvious slab on good hidden holds to the top. THE VALLEY WILD 23m HS (4a/b) Start at the right-hand end of the higher terrace at an area of light-coloured quartzy rock. Go up a short curving crack and the short horizontal joints above it to reach the base of a crack. Climb the smooth slab to the left of the crack (crux)to finish. The next four routes start off the lower right-hand grassy terrace. This terrace can be reached by scrambling up the right-hand side of the buttress. GRANISTER 16m S (4a) Start at the left side of the terrace below a dirty corner. Climb up just to the right of a right-trending quartzy crack, to the small overhang. Go straight up over the overhang and belay on a block. STONE MAIDEN 30m S (4a) Start just to the right of Granister. Surmount the slight bulge (thread runner above it), move right and climb up just left of the narrow chimney over short horizontal joints until just level with the top of Granister. Finish up the tiers of rock and vegetation to the right of the arête. SLEEP-WALKER 14m VD Takes the long crack 4m to the right of Stone Maiden which leads up into the narrow chimney on the left side of the small overhang. Bridge up the crack and chimney to the top. TOE THE LINE 15m VS (4b) Start just right of Sleep-Walker and climb up a small ledge and the smooth wall to beneath the right-hand side of the overhang. Up past the break and work out right for 2m on small footholds to gain a short wide crack. Up this to finish. ====GLENMALURE LE BUET==== Immediately above the car park on the Northern slope of the valley is a small sport crag with 4 completed lines. The rock is very compact granite/schist with no natural protection. 4 routes have been equipped. Location: 52°59'21.7\"N 6°24'26.5\"W https://goo.gl/maps/8ugvbBqTAEDQPNb46 From left to right facing the crag: - FROM THE RIVER 12m 6a+ - LE BUET 12m 6b+ - TO THE SEA 15m 6c+ - RIGHT OF RETURN 12m 7a ====BARAVORE VALLEY/ BENLEAGH==== (also known as Fraughan Rock Glen or The Three Valleys or Bolinaskea - Buaile na Sciatha ) is approached by crossing the ford/bridge on the Avonbeg at Baravore turning towards the hostel and after 100m heading up the obvious spur to the left of the old mine building. On reaching the forest road follow it in a generally southwest to west direction until the scree slopes on the right-hand side of the valley come into sight above the forest, more or less directly ahead. Follow a slightly descending section of the track to a sharp left-hand bend,marked on the left by a large boulder, and continue for 100m to the foot of the falling ground. Turn in to the right and skirt some scraggy trees to a moraine which leads up through the forest to steep grass and heather slopes. Above can be seen a prominent gully to the left of The Rock of Baravore -a vegetated wall of rock forming the rim of the valley. This is known to climbers as Great Gully and is reached from the car park in less than one hour. The setting is wild and impressive with some excellent climbing. The Gully is 250m higher than Glendalough crag and so is more prone to cold winds. It shows its magnificence best on a fine day while in dull weather it can provide preparation for the Alps. Unstable or loose blocks are possible, due to the thin, serrated nature of the ridge, and care should always be exercised. Active erosion in the higher reaches of the gully makes descent difficult and unpleasant, particularly in rock boots. An abseil chain has been placed at the top of Great Gully Route. If this is to your satisfaction it will just be possible to reach the gully floor by using two 50m ropes. The climbs are found on the right-hand side when facing up the Gully and are described from the bottom upwards. See the location of the crag at Routes 22 & 45 and location of crag Download topos of the crag at Page 251 FLEETING SUMMER 32m E1 (5b) This route starts at a toe of rock at the bottom right side of the gully, 2m to the right of the Great Gully Route corner. Gain the narrow slab delicately from the left and climb up to a small overhang which is taken on its front face. Move left and up the short grassy corner to a heather ledge beneath an undercut hanging groove. Gain the groove with difficulty and reach up to a horizontal break. Traverse out left onto the steep slab and climb up steeply to reach a narrow foot-ledge at the break. Continue up the centre of the slab and easier blocks beyond to gain a good thread and flake belay on the right side of the ridge. To escape, scramble down to the right. GREAT GULLY RIDGE ** 140m HS (4a,3c,4b,4a) This climb takes a line up the rock ridge which bounds the right-hand side of Great Gully; good clean climbing in a very fine situation. Best enjoyed with not more than 4 people on the route to savour the full flavour. Big groups take away from the experience and the tail-enders can expect to arrive home late. Start in the corner at the bottom right of the gully. (1) 10m Climb the corner to wide crack. Belay under a roof at the top of crack (2) 45m Gain the ridge and follow it directly to large stepping stones and easy ground. (3) 40m Move rightwards up steps and then climb a crack in the right corner of the slab above (crux) or more easily move up right via leaning corners and then back left above the crack. Gain height to a large platform visible from below. (4) 45m Move rightward to a short grassy wall. Move left up this for 3m to the base of a chimney with jammed blocks. Climb these to the top. Pitch not identified by anyone who sought it. It may describe going up via the off-width crack in the variation below. Variation: (4a) Climb a short grassy bank and step up left onto a wide ledge beneath an overhanging off width crack. Move on and down to the end of the ledge (belaying here reduces rope drag) and step up onto a small heathery ledge in a corner. Climb the corner to a ledge and continue up a cracked wall above it. Scramble across the face to a pointed detached block. Finish up the slope behind this. Overview Of Great Gully Ridge Photo: Nick Simons D-FOR-DOG* 18m VS (4b) Start just left of Great Gully corner at the bottom of the obvious clean slab. Climb the arête to the overhang and follow the parallel cracks to the ridge. FLAKE* 15m E1 (5b) Start 15m up on the right side of the gully. Climb broken rock to a grassy ledge beneath the triangular face. Follow the crack-line, trending leftwards to the sharp flake then move rightwards to finish at the boulder on the ridge. THE RAMP 15m VS (4b) Take the steep ramp to the left of the triangular face to the large overhang. Move right to finish. NOT Z BACKWARDS* 25m HVS (5b) Unknown first accent. LET THE HARE SIT 20m VS (4a/4b) From the top of the detached block this route takes the line via the short cracks above it (crux)then up easier ground on good holds to the half way mark. Veer up steeply right on large holds and good friction a meter or so in from the right edge to gain G.G.Ridge. THREE MAD SHEEP (Great Gully) 27m VS (High in the grade) Start on the right hand side of the giant rock pedestal, where the pedestal butts up to the face two meters right of Pauls Crack. Pitch one 22 meters VS. Start at the very wide crack almost like a chimney at the bottom. Climb this all the way as it closes in to form a crack, difficulty increases with height. Athletically finish lay back moves from rounded pulls. Belay on top of grass ledge from nut on face and large block on top of Gully Crack. Pitch two S 5 meters. Step out right and climb wall above on rounded but good friction holds, tending steeply to right. Good belay on ridge. PAUL'S CRACK 18m VS 4b Starts a further 20m up the gully. This route follows the obvious wide crack on the right side of the giant rock pedestal. Z BACKWARDS* 25m VS (4a/4b) Start under the left end of the overhang. Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

            "description": "This eliminate type slab climb, which has an unprotected crux, starts 2m to the left of the Cyclone Corner crack below a steep narrow slab going up to the left side of an overhang with a holly tree. Climb the delicate slab (avoiding any recourse to the crack) working gradually left towards the top to a small pedestal foothold on the left side of the slab above a heather ledge. Edge back right and pull up on the rounded top edge of the slab to the break just left of the overhang. Continue up the easier slab to the left of the overhang to the terrace. CYCLONE CORNER 52m VS (4c,4a) Start at the bottom right of the buttress at a partly vegetated crack which runs up to an overhang with a holly tree. Nature is reclaiming this route. 1. 22m Climb the crack to the overhang. Move out slightly left onto the steep slab and around the overhang (crux) to a stance. Climb the corner above, which is awkward to start. Belay at the terrace. 2. 30m Start in the middle of the wall (just right of Stone Maiden) about 2m left of the obvious crack. Climb up on small edges passing a diagonal crack to just below a horizontal break. Move out left to a heathery stance. Move up and diagonally right along a crack for about 6m and gain a slabby edge. Follow this to the top The following two climbs start off the higher left-hand level of the offset grassy terrace. PROCTOR'S SLAB 23m S (3c) Gives a good finish to Leftieswell. From the top of Leftieswell climb the centre of the obvious slab on good hidden holds to the top. THE VALLEY WILD 23m HS (4a/b) Start at the right-hand end of the higher terrace at an area of light-coloured quartzy rock. Go up a short curving crack and the short horizontal joints above it to reach the base of a crack. Climb the smooth slab to the left of the crack (crux)to finish. The next four routes start off the lower right-hand grassy terrace. This terrace can be reached by scrambling up the right-hand side of the buttress. GRANISTER 16m S (4a) Start at the left side of the terrace below a dirty corner. Climb up just to the right of a right-trending quartzy crack, to the small overhang. Go straight up over the overhang and belay on a block. STONE MAIDEN 30m S (4a) Start just to the right of Granister. Surmount the slight bulge (thread runner above it), move right and climb up just left of the narrow chimney over short horizontal joints until just level with the top of Granister. Finish up the tiers of rock and vegetation to the right of the arête. SLEEP-WALKER 14m VD Takes the long crack 4m to the right of Stone Maiden which leads up into the narrow chimney on the left side of the small overhang. Bridge up the crack and chimney to the top. TOE THE LINE 15m VS (4b) Start just right of Sleep-Walker and climb up a small ledge and the smooth wall to beneath the right-hand side of the overhang. Up past the break and work out right for 2m on small footholds to gain a short wide crack. Up this to finish. ====GLENMALURE LE BUET==== Immediately above the car park on the Northern slope of the valley is a small sport crag with 4 completed lines. The rock is very compact granite/schist with no natural protection. 4 routes have been equipped. Location: 52°59'21.7\"N 6°24'26.5\"W https://goo.gl/maps/8ugvbBqTAEDQPNb46 From left to right facing the crag: - FROM THE RIVER 12m 6a+ - LE BUET 12m 6b+ - TO THE SEA 15m 6c+ - RIGHT OF RETURN 12m 7a ====BARAVORE VALLEY/ BENLEAGH==== (also known as Fraughan Rock Glen or The Three Valleys or Bolinaskea - Buaile na Sciatha ) is approached by crossing the ford/bridge on the Avonbeg at Baravore turning towards the hostel and after 100m heading up the obvious spur to the left of the old mine building. On reaching the forest road follow it in a generally southwest to west direction until the scree slopes on the right-hand side of the valley come into sight above the forest, more or less directly ahead. Follow a slightly descending section of the track to a sharp left-hand bend,marked on the left by a large boulder, and continue for 100m to the foot of the falling ground. Turn in to the right and skirt some scraggy trees to a moraine which leads up through the forest to steep grass and heather slopes. Above can be seen a prominent gully to the left of The Rock of Baravore -a vegetated wall of rock forming the rim of the valley. This is known to climbers as Great Gully and is reached from the car park in less than one hour. The setting is wild and impressive with some excellent climbing. The Gully is 250m higher than Glendalough crag and so is more prone to cold winds. It shows its magnificence best on a fine day while in dull weather it can provide preparation for the Alps. Unstable or loose blocks are possible, due to the thin, serrated nature of the ridge, and care should always be exercised. Active erosion in the higher reaches of the gully makes descent difficult and unpleasant, particularly in rock boots. An abseil chain has been placed at the top of Great Gully Route. If this is to your satisfaction it will just be possible to reach the gully floor by using two 50m ropes. The climbs are found on the right-hand side when facing up the Gully and are described from the bottom upwards. See the location of the crag at Routes 22 & 45 and location of crag Download topos of the crag at Page 251 FLEETING SUMMER 32m E1 (5b) This route starts at a toe of rock at the bottom right side of the gully, 2m to the right of the Great Gully Route corner. Gain the narrow slab delicately from the left and climb up to a small overhang which is taken on its front face. Move left and up the short grassy corner to a heather ledge beneath an undercut hanging groove. Gain the groove with difficulty and reach up to a horizontal break. Traverse out left onto the steep slab and climb up steeply to reach a narrow foot-ledge at the break. Continue up the centre of the slab and easier blocks beyond to gain a good thread and flake belay on the right side of the ridge. To escape, scramble down to the right. GREAT GULLY RIDGE ** 140m HS (4a,3c,4b,4a) This climb takes a line up the rock ridge which bounds the right-hand side of Great Gully; good clean climbing in a very fine situation. Best enjoyed with not more than 4 people on the route to savour the full flavour. Big groups take away from the experience and the tail-enders can expect to arrive home late. Start in the corner at the bottom right of the gully. (1) 10m Climb the corner to wide crack. Belay under a roof at the top of crack (2) 45m Gain the ridge and follow it directly to large stepping stones and easy ground. (3) 40m Move rightwards up steps and then climb a crack in the right corner of the slab above (crux) or more easily move up right via leaning corners and then back left above the crack. Gain height to a large platform visible from below. (4) 45m Move rightward to a short grassy wall. Move left up this for 3m to the base of a chimney with jammed blocks. Climb these to the top. Pitch not identified by anyone who sought it. It may describe going up via the off-width crack in the variation below. Variation: (4a) Climb a short grassy bank and step up left onto a wide ledge beneath an overhanging off width crack. Move on and down to the end of the ledge (belaying here reduces rope drag) and step up onto a small heathery ledge in a corner. Climb the corner to a ledge and continue up a cracked wall above it. Scramble across the face to a pointed detached block. Finish up the slope behind this. Overview Of Great Gully Ridge Photo: Nick Simons D-FOR-DOG* 18m VS (4b) Start just left of Great Gully corner at the bottom of the obvious clean slab. Climb the arête to the overhang and follow the parallel cracks to the ridge. FLAKE* 15m E1 (5b) Start 15m up on the right side of the gully. Climb broken rock to a grassy ledge beneath the triangular face. Follow the crack-line, trending leftwards to the sharp flake then move rightwards to finish at the boulder on the ridge. THE RAMP 15m VS (4b) Take the steep ramp to the left of the triangular face to the large overhang. Move right to finish. NOT Z BACKWARDS* 25m HVS (5b) Unknown first accent. LET THE HARE SIT 20m VS (4a/4b) From the top of the detached block this route takes the line via the short cracks above it (crux)then up easier ground on good holds to the half way mark. Veer up steeply right on large holds and good friction a meter or so in from the right edge to gain G.G.Ridge. THREE MAD SHEEP (Great Gully) 27m VS (High in the grade) Start on the right hand side of the giant rock pedestal, where the pedestal butts up to the face two meters right of Pauls Crack. Pitch one 22 meters VS. Start at the very wide crack almost like a chimney at the bottom. Climb this all the way as it closes in to form a crack, difficulty increases with height. Athletically finish lay back moves from rounded pulls. Belay on top of grass ledge from nut on face and large block on top of Gully Crack. Pitch two S 5 meters. Step out right and climb wall above on rounded but good friction holds, tending steeply to right. Good belay on ridge. PAUL'S CRACK 18m VS 4b Starts a further 20m up the gully. This route follows the obvious wide crack on the right side of the giant rock pedestal. Z BACKWARDS* 25m VS (4a/4b) Start under the left end of the overhang. Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

Climb the corner above, which is awkward to start. Belay at the terrace. 2. 30m Start in the middle of the wall (just right of Stone Maiden) about 2m left of the obvious crack. Climb up on small edges passing a diagonal crack to just below a horizontal break. Move out left to a heathery stance. Move up and diagonally right along a crack for about 6m and gain a slabby edge. Follow this to the top The following two climbs start off the higher left-hand level of the offset grassy terrace. PROCTOR'S SLAB 23m S (3c) Gives a good finish to Leftieswell. From the top of Leftieswell climb the centre of the obvious slab on good hidden holds to the top. THE VALLEY WILD 23m HS (4a/b) Start at the right-hand end of the higher terrace at an area of light-coloured quartzy rock. Go up a short curving crack and the short horizontal joints above it to reach the base of a crack. Climb the smooth slab to the left of the crack (crux)to finish. The next four routes start off the lower right-hand grassy terrace. This terrace can be reached by scrambling up the right-hand side of the buttress.

Go straight up over the overhang and belay on a block. STONE MAIDEN 30m S (4a) Start just to the right of Granister. Surmount the slight bulge (thread runner above it), move right and climb up just left of the narrow chimney over short horizontal joints until just level with the top of Granister. Finish up the tiers of rock and vegetation to the right of the arête. SLEEP-WALKER 14m VD Takes the long crack 4m to the right of Stone Maiden which leads up into the narrow chimney on the left side of the small overhang. Bridge up the crack and chimney to the top. TOE THE LINE 15m VS (4b) Start just right of Sleep-Walker and climb up a small ledge and the smooth wall to beneath the right-hand side of the overhang. Up past the break and work out right for 2m on small footholds to gain a short wide crack. Up this to finish. ====GLENMALURE LE BUET==== Immediately above the car park on the Northern slope of the valley is a small sport crag with 4 completed lines. The rock is very compact granite/schist with no natural protection. 4 routes have been equipped. Location: 52°59'21.7\"N 6°24'26.5\"W https://goo.gl/maps/8ugvbBqTAEDQPNb46 From left to right facing the crag: - FROM THE RIVER 12m 6a+ - LE BUET 12m 6b+ - TO THE SEA 15m 6c+ - RIGHT OF RETURN 12m 7a ====BARAVORE VALLEY/ BENLEAGH==== (also known as Fraughan Rock Glen or The Three Valleys or Bolinaskea - Buaile na Sciatha ) is approached by crossing the ford/bridge on the Avonbeg at Baravore turning towards the hostel and after 100m heading up the obvious spur to the left of the old mine building. On reaching the forest road follow it in a generally southwest to west direction until the scree slopes on the right-hand side of the valley come into sight above the forest, more or less directly ahead. Follow a slightly descending section of the track to a sharp left-hand bend,marked on the left by a large boulder, and continue for 100m to the foot of the falling ground. Turn in to the right and skirt some scraggy trees to a moraine which leads up through the forest to steep grass and heather slopes. Above can be seen a prominent gully to the left of The Rock of Baravore -a vegetated wall of rock forming the rim of the valley. This is known to climbers as Great Gully and is reached from the car park in less than one hour. The setting is wild and impressive with some excellent climbing. The Gully is 250m higher than Glendalough crag and so is more prone to cold winds. It shows its magnificence best on a fine day while in dull weather it can provide preparation for the Alps. Unstable or loose blocks are possible, due to the thin, serrated nature of the ridge, and care should always be exercised. Active erosion in the higher reaches of the gully makes descent difficult and unpleasant, particularly in rock boots. An abseil chain has been placed at the top of Great Gully Route. If this is to your satisfaction it will just be possible to reach the gully floor by using two 50m ropes. The climbs are found on the right-hand side when facing up the Gully and are described from the bottom upwards. See the location of the crag at Routes 22 & 45 and location of crag Download topos of the crag at Page 251 FLEETING SUMMER 32m E1 (5b) This route starts at a toe of rock at the bottom right side of the gully, 2m to the right of the Great Gully Route corner. Gain the narrow slab delicately from the left and climb up to a small overhang which is taken on its front face. Move left and up the short grassy corner to a heather ledge beneath an undercut hanging groove. Gain the groove with difficulty and reach up to a horizontal break. Traverse out left onto the steep slab and climb up steeply to reach a narrow foot-ledge at the break. Continue up the centre of the slab and easier blocks beyond to gain a good thread and flake belay on the right side of the ridge. To escape, scramble down to the right. GREAT GULLY RIDGE ** 140m HS (4a,3c,4b,4a) This climb takes a line up the rock ridge which bounds the right-hand side of Great Gully; good clean climbing in a very fine situation. Best enjoyed with not more than 4 people on the route to savour the full flavour. Big groups take away from the experience and the tail-enders can expect to arrive home late. Start in the corner at the bottom right of the gully. (1) 10m Climb the corner to wide crack. Belay under a roof at the top of crack (2) 45m Gain the ridge and follow it directly to large stepping stones and easy ground. (3) 40m Move rightwards up steps and then climb a crack in the right corner of the slab above (crux) or more easily move up right via leaning corners and then back left above the crack. Gain height to a large platform visible from below. (4) 45m Move rightward to a short grassy wall. Move left up this for 3m to the base of a chimney with jammed blocks. Climb these to the top. Pitch not identified by anyone who sought it. It may describe going up via the off-width crack in the variation below. Variation: (4a) Climb a short grassy bank and step up left onto a wide ledge beneath an overhanging off width crack. Move on and down to the end of the ledge (belaying here reduces rope drag) and step up onto a small heathery ledge in a corner. Climb the corner to a ledge and continue up a cracked wall above it. Scramble across the face to a pointed detached block. Finish up the slope behind this. Overview Of Great Gully Ridge Photo: Nick Simons D-FOR-DOG* 18m VS (4b) Start just left of Great Gully corner at the bottom of the obvious clean slab. Climb the arête to the overhang and follow the parallel cracks to the ridge. FLAKE* 15m E1 (5b) Start 15m up on the right side of the gully. Climb broken rock to a grassy ledge beneath the triangular face. Follow the crack-line, trending leftwards to the sharp flake then move rightwards to finish at the boulder on the ridge. THE RAMP 15m VS (4b) Take the steep ramp to the left of the triangular face to the large overhang. Move right to finish. NOT Z BACKWARDS* 25m HVS (5b) Unknown first accent. LET THE HARE SIT 20m VS (4a/4b) From the top of the detached block this route takes the line via the short cracks above it (crux)then up easier ground on good holds to the half way mark. Veer up steeply right on large holds and good friction a meter or so in from the right edge to gain G.G.Ridge. THREE MAD SHEEP (Great Gully) 27m VS (High in the grade) Start on the right hand side of the giant rock pedestal, where the pedestal butts up to the face two meters right of Pauls Crack. Pitch one 22 meters VS. Start at the very wide crack almost like a chimney at the bottom. Climb this all the way as it closes in to form a crack, difficulty increases with height. Athletically finish lay back moves from rounded pulls. Belay on top of grass ledge from nut on face and large block on top of Gully Crack. Pitch two S 5 meters. Step out right and climb wall above on rounded but good friction holds, tending steeply to right. Good belay on ridge. PAUL'S CRACK 18m VS 4b Starts a further 20m up the gully. This route follows the obvious wide crack on the right side of the giant rock pedestal. Z BACKWARDS* 25m VS (4a/4b) Start under the left end of the overhang. Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

THE VALLEY WILD 23m HS (4a/b) Start at the right-hand end of the higher terrace at an area of light-coloured quartzy rock. Go up a short curving crack and the short horizontal joints above it to reach the base of a crack. Climb the smooth slab to the left of the crack (crux)to finish. The next four routes start off the lower right-hand grassy terrace. This terrace can be reached by scrambling up the right-hand side of the buttress. GRANISTER 16m S (4a) Start at the left side of the terrace below a dirty corner. Climb up just to the right of a right-trending quartzy crack, to the small overhang. Go straight up over the overhang and belay on a block. STONE MAIDEN 30m S (4a) Start just to the right of Granister. Surmount the slight bulge (thread runner above it), move right and climb up just left of the narrow chimney over short horizontal joints until just level with the top of Granister. Finish up the tiers of rock and vegetation to the right of the arête. SLEEP-WALKER 14m VD Takes the long crack 4m to the right of Stone Maiden which leads up into the narrow chimney on the left side of the small overhang. Bridge up the crack and chimney to the top. TOE THE LINE 15m VS (4b) Start just right of Sleep-Walker and climb up a small ledge and the smooth wall to beneath the right-hand side of the overhang. Up past the break and work out right for 2m on small footholds to gain a short wide crack. Up this to finish. ====GLENMALURE LE BUET==== Immediately above the car park on the Northern slope of the valley is a small sport crag with 4 completed lines. The rock is very compact granite/schist with no natural protection. 4 routes have been equipped. Location: 52°59'21.7\"N 6°24'26.5\"W https://goo.gl/maps/8ugvbBqTAEDQPNb46 From left to right facing the crag: - FROM THE RIVER 12m 6a+ - LE BUET 12m 6b+ - TO THE SEA 15m 6c+ - RIGHT OF RETURN 12m 7a ====BARAVORE VALLEY/ BENLEAGH==== (also known as Fraughan Rock Glen or The Three Valleys or Bolinaskea - Buaile na Sciatha ) is approached by crossing the ford/bridge on the Avonbeg at Baravore turning towards the hostel and after 100m heading up the obvious spur to the left of the old mine building. On reaching the forest road follow it in a generally southwest to west direction until the scree slopes on the right-hand side of the valley come into sight above the forest, more or less directly ahead. Follow a slightly descending section of the track to a sharp left-hand bend,marked on the left by a large boulder, and continue for 100m to the foot of the falling ground. Turn in to the right and skirt some scraggy trees to a moraine which leads up through the forest to steep grass and heather slopes. Above can be seen a prominent gully to the left of The Rock of Baravore -a vegetated wall of rock forming the rim of the valley. This is known to climbers as Great Gully and is reached from the car park in less than one hour. The setting is wild and impressive with some excellent climbing. The Gully is 250m higher than Glendalough crag and so is more prone to cold winds. It shows its magnificence best on a fine day while in dull weather it can provide preparation for the Alps. Unstable or loose blocks are possible, due to the thin, serrated nature of the ridge, and care should always be exercised. Active erosion in the higher reaches of the gully makes descent difficult and unpleasant, particularly in rock boots. An abseil chain has been placed at the top of Great Gully Route. If this is to your satisfaction it will just be possible to reach the gully floor by using two 50m ropes. The climbs are found on the right-hand side when facing up the Gully and are described from the bottom upwards. See the location of the crag at Routes 22 & 45 and location of crag Download topos of the crag at Page 251 FLEETING SUMMER 32m E1 (5b) This route starts at a toe of rock at the bottom right side of the gully, 2m to the right of the Great Gully Route corner. Gain the narrow slab delicately from the left and climb up to a small overhang which is taken on its front face. Move left and up the short grassy corner to a heather ledge beneath an undercut hanging groove. Gain the groove with difficulty and reach up to a horizontal break. Traverse out left onto the steep slab and climb up steeply to reach a narrow foot-ledge at the break. Continue up the centre of the slab and easier blocks beyond to gain a good thread and flake belay on the right side of the ridge. To escape, scramble down to the right. GREAT GULLY RIDGE ** 140m HS (4a,3c,4b,4a) This climb takes a line up the rock ridge which bounds the right-hand side of Great Gully; good clean climbing in a very fine situation. Best enjoyed with not more than 4 people on the route to savour the full flavour. Big groups take away from the experience and the tail-enders can expect to arrive home late.

Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

Go up a short curving crack and the short horizontal joints above it to reach the base of a crack. Climb the smooth slab to the left of the crack (crux)to finish. The next four routes start off the lower right-hand grassy terrace. This terrace can be reached by scrambling up the right-hand side of the buttress. GRANISTER 16m S (4a) Start at the left side of the terrace below a dirty corner. Climb up just to the right of a right-trending quartzy crack, to the small overhang. Go straight up over the overhang and belay on a block. STONE MAIDEN 30m S (4a) Start just to the right of Granister. Surmount the slight bulge (thread runner above it), move right and climb up just left of the narrow chimney over short horizontal joints until just level with the top of Granister. Finish up the tiers of rock and vegetation to the right of the arête. SLEEP-WALKER 14m VD Takes the long crack 4m to the right of Stone Maiden which leads up into the narrow chimney on the left side of the small overhang. Bridge up the crack and chimney to the top. TOE THE LINE 15m VS (4b) Start just right of Sleep-Walker and climb up a small ledge and the smooth wall to beneath the right-hand side of the overhang. Up past the break and work out right for 2m on small footholds to gain a short wide crack. Up this to finish. ====GLENMALURE LE BUET==== Immediately above the car park on the Northern slope of the valley is a small sport crag with 4 completed lines. The rock is very compact granite/schist with no natural protection. 4 routes have been equipped. Location: 52°59'21.7\"N 6°24'26.5\"W https://goo.gl/maps/8ugvbBqTAEDQPNb46 From left to right facing the crag: - FROM THE RIVER 12m 6a+ - LE BUET 12m 6b+ - TO THE SEA 15m 6c+ - RIGHT OF RETURN 12m 7a ====BARAVORE VALLEY/ BENLEAGH==== (also known as Fraughan Rock Glen or The Three Valleys or Bolinaskea - Buaile na Sciatha ) is approached by crossing the ford/bridge on the Avonbeg at Baravore turning towards the hostel and after 100m heading up the obvious spur to the left of the old mine building. On reaching the forest road follow it in a generally southwest to west direction until the scree slopes on the right-hand side of the valley come into sight above the forest, more or less directly ahead. Follow a slightly descending section of the track to a sharp left-hand bend,marked on the left by a large boulder, and continue for 100m to the foot of the falling ground. Turn in to the right and skirt some scraggy trees to a moraine which leads up through the forest to steep grass and heather slopes. Above can be seen a prominent gully to the left of The Rock of Baravore -a vegetated wall of rock forming the rim of the valley. This is known to climbers as Great Gully and is reached from the car park in less than one hour. The setting is wild and impressive with some excellent climbing. The Gully is 250m higher than Glendalough crag and so is more prone to cold winds. It shows its magnificence best on a fine day while in dull weather it can provide preparation for the Alps. Unstable or loose blocks are possible, due to the thin, serrated nature of the ridge, and care should always be exercised. Active erosion in the higher reaches of the gully makes descent difficult and unpleasant, particularly in rock boots. An abseil chain has been placed at the top of Great Gully Route. If this is to your satisfaction it will just be possible to reach the gully floor by using two 50m ropes. The climbs are found on the right-hand side when facing up the Gully and are described from the bottom upwards. See the location of the crag at Routes 22 & 45 and location of crag Download topos of the crag at Page 251 FLEETING SUMMER 32m E1 (5b) This route starts at a toe of rock at the bottom right side of the gully, 2m to the right of the Great Gully Route corner. Gain the narrow slab delicately from the left and climb up to a small overhang which is taken on its front face. Move left and up the short grassy corner to a heather ledge beneath an undercut hanging groove. Gain the groove with difficulty and reach up to a horizontal break. Traverse out left onto the steep slab and climb up steeply to reach a narrow foot-ledge at the break. Continue up the centre of the slab and easier blocks beyond to gain a good thread and flake belay on the right side of the ridge. To escape, scramble down to the right. GREAT GULLY RIDGE ** 140m HS (4a,3c,4b,4a) This climb takes a line up the rock ridge which bounds the right-hand side of Great Gully; good clean climbing in a very fine situation. Best enjoyed with not more than 4 people on the route to savour the full flavour. Big groups take away from the experience and the tail-enders can expect to arrive home late. Start in the corner at the bottom right of the gully. (1) 10m Climb the corner to wide crack. Belay under a roof at the top of crack (2) 45m Gain the ridge and follow it directly to large stepping stones and easy ground. (3) 40m Move rightwards up steps and then climb a crack in the right corner of the slab above (crux) or more easily move up right via leaning corners and then back left above the crack. Gain height to a large platform visible from below. (4) 45m Move rightward to a short grassy wall. Move left up this for 3m to the base of a chimney with jammed blocks. Climb these to the top. Pitch not identified by anyone who sought it. It may describe going up via the off-width crack in the variation below. Variation: (4a) Climb a short grassy bank and step up left onto a wide ledge beneath an overhanging off width crack. Move on and down to the end of the ledge (belaying here reduces rope drag) and step up onto a small heathery ledge in a corner. Climb the corner to a ledge and continue up a cracked wall above it. Scramble across the face to a pointed detached block. Finish up the slope behind this. Overview Of Great Gully Ridge Photo: Nick Simons D-FOR-DOG* 18m VS (4b) Start just left of Great Gully corner at the bottom of the obvious clean slab. Climb the arête to the overhang and follow the parallel cracks to the ridge. FLAKE* 15m E1 (5b) Start 15m up on the right side of the gully. Climb broken rock to a grassy ledge beneath the triangular face. Follow the crack-line, trending leftwards to the sharp flake then move rightwards to finish at the boulder on the ridge. THE RAMP 15m VS (4b) Take the steep ramp to the left of the triangular face to the large overhang. Move right to finish. NOT Z BACKWARDS* 25m HVS (5b) Unknown first accent. LET THE HARE SIT 20m VS (4a/4b) From the top of the detached block this route takes the line via the short cracks above it (crux)then up easier ground on good holds to the half way mark. Veer up steeply right on large holds and good friction a meter or so in from the right edge to gain G.G.Ridge. THREE MAD SHEEP (Great Gully) 27m VS (High in the grade) Start on the right hand side of the giant rock pedestal, where the pedestal butts up to the face two meters right of Pauls Crack. Pitch one 22 meters VS. Start at the very wide crack almost like a chimney at the bottom. Climb this all the way as it closes in to form a crack, difficulty increases with height. Athletically finish lay back moves from rounded pulls. Belay on top of grass ledge from nut on face and large block on top of Gully Crack. Pitch two S 5 meters. Step out right and climb wall above on rounded but good friction holds, tending steeply to right. Good belay on ridge. PAUL'S CRACK 18m VS 4b Starts a further 20m up the gully. This route follows the obvious wide crack on the right side of the giant rock pedestal. Z BACKWARDS* 25m VS (4a/4b) Start under the left end of the overhang. Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

Go straight up over the overhang and belay on a block. STONE MAIDEN 30m S (4a) Start just to the right of Granister. Surmount the slight bulge (thread runner above it), move right and climb up just left of the narrow chimney over short horizontal joints until just level with the top of Granister. Finish up the tiers of rock and vegetation to the right of the arête. SLEEP-WALKER 14m VD Takes the long crack 4m to the right of Stone Maiden which leads up into the narrow chimney on the left side of the small overhang. Bridge up the crack and chimney to the top. TOE THE LINE 15m VS (4b) Start just right of Sleep-Walker and climb up a small ledge and the smooth wall to beneath the right-hand side of the overhang. Up past the break and work out right for 2m on small footholds to gain a short wide crack. Up this to finish. ====GLENMALURE LE BUET==== Immediately above the car park on the Northern slope of the valley is a small sport crag with 4 completed lines. The rock is very compact granite/schist with no natural protection. 4 routes have been equipped. Location: 52°59'21.7\"N 6°24'26.5\"W https://goo.gl/maps/8ugvbBqTAEDQPNb46 From left to right facing the crag: - FROM THE RIVER 12m 6a+ - LE BUET 12m 6b+ - TO THE SEA 15m 6c+ - RIGHT OF RETURN 12m 7a ====BARAVORE VALLEY/ BENLEAGH==== (also known as Fraughan Rock Glen or The Three Valleys or Bolinaskea - Buaile na Sciatha ) is approached by crossing the ford/bridge on the Avonbeg at Baravore turning towards the hostel and after 100m heading up the obvious spur to the left of the old mine building. On reaching the forest road follow it in a generally southwest to west direction until the scree slopes on the right-hand side of the valley come into sight above the forest, more or less directly ahead. Follow a slightly descending section of the track to a sharp left-hand bend,marked on the left by a large boulder, and continue for 100m to the foot of the falling ground. Turn in to the right and skirt some scraggy trees to a moraine which leads up through the forest to steep grass and heather slopes. Above can be seen a prominent gully to the left of The Rock of Baravore -a vegetated wall of rock forming the rim of the valley. This is known to climbers as Great Gully and is reached from the car park in less than one hour. The setting is wild and impressive with some excellent climbing. The Gully is 250m higher than Glendalough crag and so is more prone to cold winds. It shows its magnificence best on a fine day while in dull weather it can provide preparation for the Alps. Unstable or loose blocks are possible, due to the thin, serrated nature of the ridge, and care should always be exercised. Active erosion in the higher reaches of the gully makes descent difficult and unpleasant, particularly in rock boots. An abseil chain has been placed at the top of Great Gully Route. If this is to your satisfaction it will just be possible to reach the gully floor by using two 50m ropes. The climbs are found on the right-hand side when facing up the Gully and are described from the bottom upwards. See the location of the crag at Routes 22 & 45 and location of crag Download topos of the crag at Page 251 FLEETING SUMMER 32m E1 (5b) This route starts at a toe of rock at the bottom right side of the gully, 2m to the right of the Great Gully Route corner. Gain the narrow slab delicately from the left and climb up to a small overhang which is taken on its front face. Move left and up the short grassy corner to a heather ledge beneath an undercut hanging groove. Gain the groove with difficulty and reach up to a horizontal break. Traverse out left onto the steep slab and climb up steeply to reach a narrow foot-ledge at the break. Continue up the centre of the slab and easier blocks beyond to gain a good thread and flake belay on the right side of the ridge. To escape, scramble down to the right. GREAT GULLY RIDGE ** 140m HS (4a,3c,4b,4a) This climb takes a line up the rock ridge which bounds the right-hand side of Great Gully; good clean climbing in a very fine situation. Best enjoyed with not more than 4 people on the route to savour the full flavour. Big groups take away from the experience and the tail-enders can expect to arrive home late. Start in the corner at the bottom right of the gully. (1) 10m Climb the corner to wide crack. Belay under a roof at the top of crack (2) 45m Gain the ridge and follow it directly to large stepping stones and easy ground. (3) 40m Move rightwards up steps and then climb a crack in the right corner of the slab above (crux) or more easily move up right via leaning corners and then back left above the crack. Gain height to a large platform visible from below. (4) 45m Move rightward to a short grassy wall. Move left up this for 3m to the base of a chimney with jammed blocks. Climb these to the top. Pitch not identified by anyone who sought it. It may describe going up via the off-width crack in the variation below. Variation: (4a) Climb a short grassy bank and step up left onto a wide ledge beneath an overhanging off width crack. Move on and down to the end of the ledge (belaying here reduces rope drag) and step up onto a small heathery ledge in a corner. Climb the corner to a ledge and continue up a cracked wall above it. Scramble across the face to a pointed detached block. Finish up the slope behind this. Overview Of Great Gully Ridge Photo: Nick Simons D-FOR-DOG* 18m VS (4b) Start just left of Great Gully corner at the bottom of the obvious clean slab. Climb the arête to the overhang and follow the parallel cracks to the ridge. FLAKE* 15m E1 (5b) Start 15m up on the right side of the gully. Climb broken rock to a grassy ledge beneath the triangular face. Follow the crack-line, trending leftwards to the sharp flake then move rightwards to finish at the boulder on the ridge. THE RAMP 15m VS (4b) Take the steep ramp to the left of the triangular face to the large overhang. Move right to finish. NOT Z BACKWARDS* 25m HVS (5b) Unknown first accent. LET THE HARE SIT 20m VS (4a/4b) From the top of the detached block this route takes the line via the short cracks above it (crux)then up easier ground on good holds to the half way mark. Veer up steeply right on large holds and good friction a meter or so in from the right edge to gain G.G.Ridge. THREE MAD SHEEP (Great Gully) 27m VS (High in the grade) Start on the right hand side of the giant rock pedestal, where the pedestal butts up to the face two meters right of Pauls Crack. Pitch one 22 meters VS. Start at the very wide crack almost like a chimney at the bottom. Climb this all the way as it closes in to form a crack, difficulty increases with height. Athletically finish lay back moves from rounded pulls. Belay on top of grass ledge from nut on face and large block on top of Gully Crack. Pitch two S 5 meters. Step out right and climb wall above on rounded but good friction holds, tending steeply to right. Good belay on ridge. PAUL'S CRACK 18m VS 4b Starts a further 20m up the gully. This route follows the obvious wide crack on the right side of the giant rock pedestal. Z BACKWARDS* 25m VS (4a/4b) Start under the left end of the overhang. Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall.

Location: 52°59'21.7\"N 6°24'26.5\"W https://goo.gl/maps/8ugvbBqTAEDQPNb46 From left to right facing the crag: - FROM THE RIVER 12m 6a+ - LE BUET 12m 6b+ - TO THE SEA 15m 6c+ - RIGHT OF RETURN 12m 7a ====BARAVORE VALLEY/ BENLEAGH==== (also known as Fraughan Rock Glen or The Three Valleys or Bolinaskea - Buaile na Sciatha ) is approached by crossing the ford/bridge on the Avonbeg at Baravore turning towards the hostel and after 100m heading up the obvious spur to the left of the old mine building. On reaching the forest road follow it in a generally southwest to west direction until the scree slopes on the right-hand side of the valley come into sight above the forest, more or less directly ahead. Follow a slightly descending section of the track to a sharp left-hand bend,marked on the left by a large boulder, and continue for 100m to the foot of the falling ground. Turn in to the right and skirt some scraggy trees to a moraine which leads up through the forest to steep grass and heather slopes. Above can be seen a prominent gully to the left of The Rock of Baravore -a vegetated wall of rock forming the rim of the valley. This is known to climbers as Great Gully and is reached from the car park in less than one hour. The setting is wild and impressive with some excellent climbing. The Gully is 250m higher than Glendalough crag and so is more prone to cold winds. It shows its magnificence best on a fine day while in dull weather it can provide preparation for the Alps. Unstable or loose blocks are possible, due to the thin, serrated nature of the ridge, and care should always be exercised. Active erosion in the higher reaches of the gully makes descent difficult and unpleasant, particularly in rock boots. An abseil chain has been placed at the top of Great Gully Route. If this is to your satisfaction it will just be possible to reach the gully floor by using two 50m ropes. The climbs are found on the right-hand side when facing up the Gully and are described from the bottom upwards. See the location of the crag at Routes 22 & 45 and location of crag Download topos of the crag at Page 251 FLEETING SUMMER 32m E1 (5b) This route starts at a toe of rock at the bottom right side of the gully, 2m to the right of the Great Gully Route corner. Gain the narrow slab delicately from the left and climb up to a small overhang which is taken on its front face. Move left and up the short grassy corner to a heather ledge beneath an undercut hanging groove. Gain the groove with difficulty and reach up to a horizontal break. Traverse out left onto the steep slab and climb up steeply to reach a narrow foot-ledge at the break. Continue up the centre of the slab and easier blocks beyond to gain a good thread and flake belay on the right side of the ridge. To escape, scramble down to the right. GREAT GULLY RIDGE ** 140m HS (4a,3c,4b,4a) This climb takes a line up the rock ridge which bounds the right-hand side of Great Gully; good clean climbing in a very fine situation. Best enjoyed with not more than 4 people on the route to savour the full flavour. Big groups take away from the experience and the tail-enders can expect to arrive home late. Start in the corner at the bottom right of the gully. (1) 10m Climb the corner to wide crack. Belay under a roof at the top of crack (2) 45m Gain the ridge and follow it directly to large stepping stones and easy ground. (3) 40m Move rightwards up steps and then climb a crack in the right corner of the slab above (crux) or more easily move up right via leaning corners and then back left above the crack. Gain height to a large platform visible from below. (4) 45m Move rightward to a short grassy wall. Move left up this for 3m to the base of a chimney with jammed blocks. Climb these to the top. Pitch not identified by anyone who sought it. It may describe going up via the off-width crack in the variation below. Variation: (4a) Climb a short grassy bank and step up left onto a wide ledge beneath an overhanging off width crack. Move on and down to the end of the ledge (belaying here reduces rope drag) and step up onto a small heathery ledge in a corner. Climb the corner to a ledge and continue up a cracked wall above it. Scramble across the face to a pointed detached block. Finish up the slope behind this. Overview Of Great Gully Ridge Photo: Nick Simons D-FOR-DOG* 18m VS (4b) Start just left of Great Gully corner at the bottom of the obvious clean slab. Climb the arête to the overhang and follow the parallel cracks to the ridge. FLAKE* 15m E1 (5b) Start 15m up on the right side of the gully. Climb broken rock to a grassy ledge beneath the triangular face. Follow the crack-line, trending leftwards to the sharp flake then move rightwards to finish at the boulder on the ridge. THE RAMP 15m VS (4b) Take the steep ramp to the left of the triangular face to the large overhang. Move right to finish. NOT Z BACKWARDS* 25m HVS (5b) Unknown first accent. LET THE HARE SIT 20m VS (4a/4b) From the top of the detached block this route takes the line via the short cracks above it (crux)then up easier ground on good holds to the half way mark. Veer up steeply right on large holds and good friction a meter or so in from the right edge to gain G.G.Ridge. THREE MAD SHEEP (Great Gully) 27m VS (High in the grade) Start on the right hand side of the giant rock pedestal, where the pedestal butts up to the face two meters right of Pauls Crack. Pitch one 22 meters VS. Start at the very wide crack almost like a chimney at the bottom. Climb this all the way as it closes in to form a crack, difficulty increases with height. Athletically finish lay back moves from rounded pulls. Belay on top of grass ledge from nut on face and large block on top of Gully Crack. Pitch two S 5 meters. Step out right and climb wall above on rounded but good friction holds, tending steeply to right. Good belay on ridge. PAUL'S CRACK 18m VS 4b Starts a further 20m up the gully. This route follows the obvious wide crack on the right side of the giant rock pedestal. Z BACKWARDS* 25m VS (4a/4b) Start under the left end of the overhang. Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

On reaching the forest road follow it in a generally southwest to west direction until the scree slopes on the right-hand side of the valley come into sight above the forest, more or less directly ahead. Follow a slightly descending section of the track to a sharp left-hand bend,marked on the left by a large boulder, and continue for 100m to the foot of the falling ground. Turn in to the right and skirt some scraggy trees to a moraine which leads up through the forest to steep grass and heather slopes. Above can be seen a prominent gully to the left of The Rock of Baravore -a vegetated wall of rock forming the rim of the valley. This is known to climbers as Great Gully and is reached from the car park in less than one hour. The setting is wild and impressive with some excellent climbing. The Gully is 250m higher than Glendalough crag and so is more prone to cold winds. It shows its magnificence best on a fine day while in dull weather it can provide preparation for the Alps. Unstable or loose blocks are possible, due to the thin, serrated nature of the ridge, and care should always be exercised. Active erosion in the higher reaches of the gully makes descent difficult and unpleasant, particularly in rock boots. An abseil chain has been placed at the top of Great Gully Route. If this is to your satisfaction it will just be possible to reach the gully floor by using two 50m ropes. The climbs are found on the right-hand side when facing up the Gully and are described from the bottom upwards. See the location of the crag at Routes 22 & 45 and location of crag Download topos of the crag at Page 251 FLEETING SUMMER 32m E1 (5b) This route starts at a toe of rock at the bottom right side of the gully, 2m to the right of the Great Gully Route corner. Gain the narrow slab delicately from the left and climb up to a small overhang which is taken on its front face. Move left and up the short grassy corner to a heather ledge beneath an undercut hanging groove. Gain the groove with difficulty and reach up to a horizontal break. Traverse out left onto the steep slab and climb up steeply to reach a narrow foot-ledge at the break. Continue up the centre of the slab and easier blocks beyond to gain a good thread and flake belay on the right side of the ridge. To escape, scramble down to the right. GREAT GULLY RIDGE ** 140m HS (4a,3c,4b,4a) This climb takes a line up the rock ridge which bounds the right-hand side of Great Gully; good clean climbing in a very fine situation. Best enjoyed with not more than 4 people on the route to savour the full flavour. Big groups take away from the experience and the tail-enders can expect to arrive home late. Start in the corner at the bottom right of the gully. (1) 10m Climb the corner to wide crack. Belay under a roof at the top of crack (2) 45m Gain the ridge and follow it directly to large stepping stones and easy ground. (3) 40m Move rightwards up steps and then climb a crack in the right corner of the slab above (crux) or more easily move up right via leaning corners and then back left above the crack. Gain height to a large platform visible from below. (4) 45m Move rightward to a short grassy wall. Move left up this for 3m to the base of a chimney with jammed blocks. Climb these to the top. Pitch not identified by anyone who sought it. It may describe going up via the off-width crack in the variation below. Variation: (4a) Climb a short grassy bank and step up left onto a wide ledge beneath an overhanging off width crack. Move on and down to the end of the ledge (belaying here reduces rope drag) and step up onto a small heathery ledge in a corner. Climb the corner to a ledge and continue up a cracked wall above it. Scramble across the face to a pointed detached block. Finish up the slope behind this. Overview Of Great Gully Ridge Photo: Nick Simons D-FOR-DOG* 18m VS (4b) Start just left of Great Gully corner at the bottom of the obvious clean slab. Climb the arête to the overhang and follow the parallel cracks to the ridge. FLAKE* 15m E1 (5b) Start 15m up on the right side of the gully. Climb broken rock to a grassy ledge beneath the triangular face. Follow the crack-line, trending leftwards to the sharp flake then move rightwards to finish at the boulder on the ridge. THE RAMP 15m VS (4b) Take the steep ramp to the left of the triangular face to the large overhang. Move right to finish. NOT Z BACKWARDS* 25m HVS (5b) Unknown first accent. LET THE HARE SIT 20m VS (4a/4b) From the top of the detached block this route takes the line via the short cracks above it (crux)then up easier ground on good holds to the half way mark. Veer up steeply right on large holds and good friction a meter or so in from the right edge to gain G.G.Ridge. THREE MAD SHEEP (Great Gully) 27m VS (High in the grade) Start on the right hand side of the giant rock pedestal, where the pedestal butts up to the face two meters right of Pauls Crack. Pitch one 22 meters VS. Start at the very wide crack almost like a chimney at the bottom. Climb this all the way as it closes in to form a crack, difficulty increases with height. Athletically finish lay back moves from rounded pulls. Belay on top of grass ledge from nut on face and large block on top of Gully Crack. Pitch two S 5 meters. Step out right and climb wall above on rounded but good friction holds, tending steeply to right. Good belay on ridge. PAUL'S CRACK 18m VS 4b Starts a further 20m up the gully. This route follows the obvious wide crack on the right side of the giant rock pedestal. Z BACKWARDS* 25m VS (4a/4b) Start under the left end of the overhang. Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough.

The rock is very compact granite/schist with no natural protection. 4 routes have been equipped. Location: 52°59'21.7\"N 6°24'26.5\"W https://goo.gl/maps/8ugvbBqTAEDQPNb46 From left to right facing the crag: - FROM THE RIVER 12m 6a+ - LE BUET 12m 6b+ - TO THE SEA 15m 6c+ - RIGHT OF RETURN 12m 7a ====BARAVORE VALLEY/ BENLEAGH==== (also known as Fraughan Rock Glen or The Three Valleys or Bolinaskea - Buaile na Sciatha ) is approached by crossing the ford/bridge on the Avonbeg at Baravore turning towards the hostel and after 100m heading up the obvious spur to the left of the old mine building. On reaching the forest road follow it in a generally southwest to west direction until the scree slopes on the right-hand side of the valley come into sight above the forest, more or less directly ahead. Follow a slightly descending section of the track to a sharp left-hand bend,marked on the left by a large boulder, and continue for 100m to the foot of the falling ground. Turn in to the right and skirt some scraggy trees to a moraine which leads up through the forest to steep grass and heather slopes. Above can be seen a prominent gully to the left of The Rock of Baravore -a vegetated wall of rock forming the rim of the valley. This is known to climbers as Great Gully and is reached from the car park in less than one hour. The setting is wild and impressive with some excellent climbing. The Gully is 250m higher than Glendalough crag and so is more prone to cold winds. It shows its magnificence best on a fine day while in dull weather it can provide preparation for the Alps. Unstable or loose blocks are possible, due to the thin, serrated nature of the ridge, and care should always be exercised. Active erosion in the higher reaches of the gully makes descent difficult and unpleasant, particularly in rock boots. An abseil chain has been placed at the top of Great Gully Route. If this is to your satisfaction it will just be possible to reach the gully floor by using two 50m ropes. The climbs are found on the right-hand side when facing up the Gully and are described from the bottom upwards. See the location of the crag at Routes 22 & 45 and location of crag Download topos of the crag at Page 251 FLEETING SUMMER 32m E1 (5b) This route starts at a toe of rock at the bottom right side of the gully, 2m to the right of the Great Gully Route corner. Gain the narrow slab delicately from the left and climb up to a small overhang which is taken on its front face. Move left and up the short grassy corner to a heather ledge beneath an undercut hanging groove. Gain the groove with difficulty and reach up to a horizontal break. Traverse out left onto the steep slab and climb up steeply to reach a narrow foot-ledge at the break. Continue up the centre of the slab and easier blocks beyond to gain a good thread and flake belay on the right side of the ridge. To escape, scramble down to the right. GREAT GULLY RIDGE ** 140m HS (4a,3c,4b,4a) This climb takes a line up the rock ridge which bounds the right-hand side of Great Gully; good clean climbing in a very fine situation. Best enjoyed with not more than 4 people on the route to savour the full flavour. Big groups take away from the experience and the tail-enders can expect to arrive home late. Start in the corner at the bottom right of the gully. (1) 10m Climb the corner to wide crack. Belay under a roof at the top of crack (2) 45m Gain the ridge and follow it directly to large stepping stones and easy ground. (3) 40m Move rightwards up steps and then climb a crack in the right corner of the slab above (crux) or more easily move up right via leaning corners and then back left above the crack. Gain height to a large platform visible from below. (4) 45m Move rightward to a short grassy wall. Move left up this for 3m to the base of a chimney with jammed blocks. Climb these to the top. Pitch not identified by anyone who sought it. It may describe going up via the off-width crack in the variation below. Variation: (4a) Climb a short grassy bank and step up left onto a wide ledge beneath an overhanging off width crack. Move on and down to the end of the ledge (belaying here reduces rope drag) and step up onto a small heathery ledge in a corner. Climb the corner to a ledge and continue up a cracked wall above it. Scramble across the face to a pointed detached block. Finish up the slope behind this. Overview Of Great Gully Ridge Photo: Nick Simons D-FOR-DOG* 18m VS (4b) Start just left of Great Gully corner at the bottom of the obvious clean slab. Climb the arête to the overhang and follow the parallel cracks to the ridge. FLAKE* 15m E1 (5b) Start 15m up on the right side of the gully. Climb broken rock to a grassy ledge beneath the triangular face. Follow the crack-line, trending leftwards to the sharp flake then move rightwards to finish at the boulder on the ridge. THE RAMP 15m VS (4b) Take the steep ramp to the left of the triangular face to the large overhang. Move right to finish. NOT Z BACKWARDS* 25m HVS (5b) Unknown first accent. LET THE HARE SIT 20m VS (4a/4b) From the top of the detached block this route takes the line via the short cracks above it (crux)then up easier ground on good holds to the half way mark. Veer up steeply right on large holds and good friction a meter or so in from the right edge to gain G.G.Ridge. THREE MAD SHEEP (Great Gully) 27m VS (High in the grade) Start on the right hand side of the giant rock pedestal, where the pedestal butts up to the face two meters right of Pauls Crack. Pitch one 22 meters VS. Start at the very wide crack almost like a chimney at the bottom. Climb this all the way as it closes in to form a crack, difficulty increases with height. Athletically finish lay back moves from rounded pulls. Belay on top of grass ledge from nut on face and large block on top of Gully Crack. Pitch two S 5 meters. Step out right and climb wall above on rounded but good friction holds, tending steeply to right. Good belay on ridge. PAUL'S CRACK 18m VS 4b Starts a further 20m up the gully. This route follows the obvious wide crack on the right side of the giant rock pedestal. Z BACKWARDS* 25m VS (4a/4b) Start under the left end of the overhang. Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one.

GREAT GULLY RIDGE ** 140m HS (4a,3c,4b,4a) This climb takes a line up the rock ridge which bounds the right-hand side of Great Gully; good clean climbing in a very fine situation. Best enjoyed with not more than 4 people on the route to savour the full flavour. Big groups take away from the experience and the tail-enders can expect to arrive home late. Start in the corner at the bottom right of the gully. (1) 10m Climb the corner to wide crack. Belay under a roof at the top of crack (2) 45m Gain the ridge and follow it directly to large stepping stones and easy ground. (3) 40m Move rightwards up steps and then climb a crack in the right corner of the slab above (crux) or more easily move up right via leaning corners and then back left above the crack. Gain height to a large platform visible from below. (4) 45m Move rightward to a short grassy wall. Move left up this for 3m to the base of a chimney with jammed blocks. Climb these to the top. Pitch not identified by anyone who sought it. It may describe going up via the off-width crack in the variation below. Variation: (4a) Climb a short grassy bank and step up left onto a wide ledge beneath an overhanging off width crack. Move on and down to the end of the ledge (belaying here reduces rope drag) and step up onto a small heathery ledge in a corner. Climb the corner to a ledge and continue up a cracked wall above it. Scramble across the face to a pointed detached block. Finish up the slope behind this. Overview Of Great Gully Ridge Photo: Nick Simons D-FOR-DOG* 18m VS (4b) Start just left of Great Gully corner at the bottom of the obvious clean slab. Climb the arête to the overhang and follow the parallel cracks to the ridge. FLAKE* 15m E1 (5b) Start 15m up on the right side of the gully. Climb broken rock to a grassy ledge beneath the triangular face. Follow the crack-line, trending leftwards to the sharp flake then move rightwards to finish at the boulder on the ridge. THE RAMP 15m VS (4b) Take the steep ramp to the left of the triangular face to the large overhang. Move right to finish. NOT Z BACKWARDS* 25m HVS (5b) Unknown first accent. LET THE HARE SIT 20m VS (4a/4b) From the top of the detached block this route takes the line via the short cracks above it (crux)then up easier ground on good holds to the half way mark. Veer up steeply right on large holds and good friction a meter or so in from the right edge to gain G.G.Ridge. THREE MAD SHEEP (Great Gully) 27m VS (High in the grade) Start on the right hand side of the giant rock pedestal, where the pedestal butts up to the face two meters right of Pauls Crack. Pitch one 22 meters VS. Start at the very wide crack almost like a chimney at the bottom. Climb this all the way as it closes in to form a crack, difficulty increases with height. Athletically finish lay back moves from rounded pulls. Belay on top of grass ledge from nut on face and large block on top of Gully Crack. Pitch two S 5 meters. Step out right and climb wall above on rounded but good friction holds, tending steeply to right. Good belay on ridge. PAUL'S CRACK 18m VS 4b Starts a further 20m up the gully. This route follows the obvious wide crack on the right side of the giant rock pedestal. Z BACKWARDS* 25m VS (4a/4b) Start under the left end of the overhang. Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

On reaching the forest road follow it in a generally southwest to west direction until the scree slopes on the right-hand side of the valley come into sight above the forest, more or less directly ahead. Follow a slightly descending section of the track to a sharp left-hand bend,marked on the left by a large boulder, and continue for 100m to the foot of the falling ground. Turn in to the right and skirt some scraggy trees to a moraine which leads up through the forest to steep grass and heather slopes. Above can be seen a prominent gully to the left of The Rock of Baravore -a vegetated wall of rock forming the rim of the valley. This is known to climbers as Great Gully and is reached from the car park in less than one hour. The setting is wild and impressive with some excellent climbing. The Gully is 250m higher than Glendalough crag and so is more prone to cold winds. It shows its magnificence best on a fine day while in dull weather it can provide preparation for the Alps. Unstable or loose blocks are possible, due to the thin, serrated nature of the ridge, and care should always be exercised. Active erosion in the higher reaches of the gully makes descent difficult and unpleasant, particularly in rock boots. An abseil chain has been placed at the top of Great Gully Route. If this is to your satisfaction it will just be possible to reach the gully floor by using two 50m ropes. The climbs are found on the right-hand side when facing up the Gully and are described from the bottom upwards. See the location of the crag at Routes 22 & 45 and location of crag Download topos of the crag at Page 251 FLEETING SUMMER 32m E1 (5b) This route starts at a toe of rock at the bottom right side of the gully, 2m to the right of the Great Gully Route corner. Gain the narrow slab delicately from the left and climb up to a small overhang which is taken on its front face. Move left and up the short grassy corner to a heather ledge beneath an undercut hanging groove. Gain the groove with difficulty and reach up to a horizontal break. Traverse out left onto the steep slab and climb up steeply to reach a narrow foot-ledge at the break. Continue up the centre of the slab and easier blocks beyond to gain a good thread and flake belay on the right side of the ridge. To escape, scramble down to the right. GREAT GULLY RIDGE ** 140m HS (4a,3c,4b,4a) This climb takes a line up the rock ridge which bounds the right-hand side of Great Gully; good clean climbing in a very fine situation. Best enjoyed with not more than 4 people on the route to savour the full flavour. Big groups take away from the experience and the tail-enders can expect to arrive home late. Start in the corner at the bottom right of the gully. (1) 10m Climb the corner to wide crack.

Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

            "description": "This route starts at a toe of rock at the bottom right side of the gully, 2m to the right of the Great Gully Route corner. Gain the narrow slab delicately from the left and climb up to a small overhang which is taken on its front face. Move left and up the short grassy corner to a heather ledge beneath an undercut hanging groove. Gain the groove with difficulty and reach up to a horizontal break. Traverse out left onto the steep slab and climb up steeply to reach a narrow foot-ledge at the break. Continue up the centre of the slab and easier blocks beyond to gain a good thread and flake belay on the right side of the ridge. To escape, scramble down to the right. GREAT GULLY RIDGE ** 140m HS (4a,3c,4b,4a) This climb takes a line up the rock ridge which bounds the right-hand side of Great Gully; good clean climbing in a very fine situation. Best enjoyed with not more than 4 people on the route to savour the full flavour. Big groups take away from the experience and the tail-enders can expect to arrive home late. Start in the corner at the bottom right of the gully. (1) 10m Climb the corner to wide crack. Belay under a roof at the top of crack (2) 45m Gain the ridge and follow it directly to large stepping stones and easy ground. (3) 40m Move rightwards up steps and then climb a crack in the right corner of the slab above (crux) or more easily move up right via leaning corners and then back left above the crack. Gain height to a large platform visible from below. (4) 45m Move rightward to a short grassy wall. Move left up this for 3m to the base of a chimney with jammed blocks. Climb these to the top. Pitch not identified by anyone who sought it. It may describe going up via the off-width crack in the variation below. Variation: (4a) Climb a short grassy bank and step up left onto a wide ledge beneath an overhanging off width crack. Move on and down to the end of the ledge (belaying here reduces rope drag) and step up onto a small heathery ledge in a corner. Climb the corner to a ledge and continue up a cracked wall above it. Scramble across the face to a pointed detached block. Finish up the slope behind this. Overview Of Great Gully Ridge Photo: Nick Simons D-FOR-DOG* 18m VS (4b) Start just left of Great Gully corner at the bottom of the obvious clean slab. Climb the arête to the overhang and follow the parallel cracks to the ridge. FLAKE* 15m E1 (5b) Start 15m up on the right side of the gully. Climb broken rock to a grassy ledge beneath the triangular face. Follow the crack-line, trending leftwards to the sharp flake then move rightwards to finish at the boulder on the ridge. THE RAMP 15m VS (4b) Take the steep ramp to the left of the triangular face to the large overhang. Move right to finish. NOT Z BACKWARDS* 25m HVS (5b) Unknown first accent. LET THE HARE SIT 20m VS (4a/4b) From the top of the detached block this route takes the line via the short cracks above it (crux)then up easier ground on good holds to the half way mark. Veer up steeply right on large holds and good friction a meter or so in from the right edge to gain G.G.Ridge. THREE MAD SHEEP (Great Gully) 27m VS (High in the grade) Start on the right hand side of the giant rock pedestal, where the pedestal butts up to the face two meters right of Pauls Crack. Pitch one 22 meters VS. Start at the very wide crack almost like a chimney at the bottom. Climb this all the way as it closes in to form a crack, difficulty increases with height. Athletically finish lay back moves from rounded pulls. Belay on top of grass ledge from nut on face and large block on top of Gully Crack. Pitch two S 5 meters. Step out right and climb wall above on rounded but good friction holds, tending steeply to right. Good belay on ridge. PAUL'S CRACK 18m VS 4b Starts a further 20m up the gully. This route follows the obvious wide crack on the right side of the giant rock pedestal. Z BACKWARDS* 25m VS (4a/4b) Start under the left end of the overhang. Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough.

Best enjoyed with not more than 4 people on the route to savour the full flavour. Big groups take away from the experience and the tail-enders can expect to arrive home late. Start in the corner at the bottom right of the gully. (1) 10m Climb the corner to wide crack. Belay under a roof at the top of crack (2) 45m Gain the ridge and follow it directly to large stepping stones and easy ground. (3) 40m Move rightwards up steps and then climb a crack in the right corner of the slab above (crux) or more easily move up right via leaning corners and then back left above the crack. Gain height to a large platform visible from below. (4) 45m Move rightward to a short grassy wall. Move left up this for 3m to the base of a chimney with jammed blocks. Climb these to the top. Pitch not identified by anyone who sought it. It may describe going up via the off-width crack in the variation below. Variation: (4a) Climb a short grassy bank and step up left onto a wide ledge beneath an overhanging off width crack. Move on and down to the end of the ledge (belaying here reduces rope drag) and step up onto a small heathery ledge in a corner. Climb the corner to a ledge and continue up a cracked wall above it. Scramble across the face to a pointed detached block. Finish up the slope behind this. Overview Of Great Gully Ridge Photo: Nick Simons D-FOR-DOG* 18m VS (4b) Start just left of Great Gully corner at the bottom of the obvious clean slab. Climb the arête to the overhang and follow the parallel cracks to the ridge. FLAKE* 15m E1 (5b) Start 15m up on the right side of the gully. Climb broken rock to a grassy ledge beneath the triangular face. Follow the crack-line, trending leftwards to the sharp flake then move rightwards to finish at the boulder on the ridge. THE RAMP 15m VS (4b) Take the steep ramp to the left of the triangular face to the large overhang. Move right to finish. NOT Z BACKWARDS* 25m HVS (5b) Unknown first accent. LET THE HARE SIT 20m VS (4a/4b) From the top of the detached block this route takes the line via the short cracks above it (crux)then up easier ground on good holds to the half way mark. Veer up steeply right on large holds and good friction a meter or so in from the right edge to gain G.G.Ridge. THREE MAD SHEEP (Great Gully) 27m VS (High in the grade) Start on the right hand side of the giant rock pedestal, where the pedestal butts up to the face two meters right of Pauls Crack. Pitch one 22 meters VS. Start at the very wide crack almost like a chimney at the bottom. Climb this all the way as it closes in to form a crack, difficulty increases with height. Athletically finish lay back moves from rounded pulls. Belay on top of grass ledge from nut on face and large block on top of Gully Crack. Pitch two S 5 meters. Step out right and climb wall above on rounded but good friction holds, tending steeply to right. Good belay on ridge. PAUL'S CRACK 18m VS 4b Starts a further 20m up the gully. This route follows the obvious wide crack on the right side of the giant rock pedestal. Z BACKWARDS* 25m VS (4a/4b) Start under the left end of the overhang. Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

Veer up steeply right on large holds and good friction a meter or so in from the right edge to gain G.G.Ridge. THREE MAD SHEEP (Great Gully) 27m VS (High in the grade) Start on the right hand side of the giant rock pedestal, where the pedestal butts up to the face two meters right of Pauls Crack. Pitch one 22 meters VS. Start at the very wide crack almost like a chimney at the bottom. Climb this all the way as it closes in to form a crack, difficulty increases with height. Athletically finish lay back moves from rounded pulls. Belay on top of grass ledge from nut on face and large block on top of Gully Crack. Pitch two S 5 meters. Step out right and climb wall above on rounded but good friction holds, tending steeply to right. Good belay on ridge. PAUL'S CRACK 18m VS 4b Starts a further 20m up the gully. This route follows the obvious wide crack on the right side of the giant rock pedestal. Z BACKWARDS* 25m VS (4a/4b) Start under the left end of the overhang. Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

Follow the crack-line, trending leftwards to the sharp flake then move rightwards to finish at the boulder on the ridge. THE RAMP 15m VS (4b) Take the steep ramp to the left of the triangular face to the large overhang. Move right to finish. NOT Z BACKWARDS* 25m HVS (5b) Unknown first accent. LET THE HARE SIT 20m VS (4a/4b) From the top of the detached block this route takes the line via the short cracks above it (crux)then up easier ground on good holds to the half way mark. Veer up steeply right on large holds and good friction a meter or so in from the right edge to gain G.G.Ridge. THREE MAD SHEEP (Great Gully) 27m VS (High in the grade) Start on the right hand side of the giant rock pedestal, where the pedestal butts up to the face two meters right of Pauls Crack. Pitch one 22 meters VS. Start at the very wide crack almost like a chimney at the bottom. Climb this all the way as it closes in to form a crack, difficulty increases with height. Athletically finish lay back moves from rounded pulls. Belay on top of grass ledge from nut on face and large block on top of Gully Crack. Pitch two S 5 meters. Step out right and climb wall above on rounded but good friction holds, tending steeply to right. Good belay on ridge. PAUL'S CRACK 18m VS 4b Starts a further 20m up the gully. This route follows the obvious wide crack on the right side of the giant rock pedestal. Z BACKWARDS* 25m VS (4a/4b) Start under the left end of the overhang. Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab.

Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack.

Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

            "description": "Unknown first accent. LET THE HARE SIT 20m VS (4a/4b) From the top of the detached block this route takes the line via the short cracks above it (crux)then up easier ground on good holds to the half way mark. Veer up steeply right on large holds and good friction a meter or so in from the right edge to gain G.G.Ridge. THREE MAD SHEEP (Great Gully) 27m VS (High in the grade) Start on the right hand side of the giant rock pedestal, where the pedestal butts up to the face two meters right of Pauls Crack. Pitch one 22 meters VS. Start at the very wide crack almost like a chimney at the bottom. Climb this all the way as it closes in to form a crack, difficulty increases with height. Athletically finish lay back moves from rounded pulls. Belay on top of grass ledge from nut on face and large block on top of Gully Crack. Pitch two S 5 meters. Step out right and climb wall above on rounded but good friction holds, tending steeply to right. Good belay on ridge. PAUL'S CRACK 18m VS 4b Starts a further 20m up the gully. This route follows the obvious wide crack on the right side of the giant rock pedestal. Z BACKWARDS* 25m VS (4a/4b) Start under the left end of the overhang. Move up and follow the well protected crack-line on the slab above. THE WINGS OF AN ANGLE 18m E2 (5c) Starts 8m to the left of Paul's Crack below the overhangs. Move diagonally to the right climbing the obvious fault (blocks). Climb the overhang (beware loose block) on to the face and follow the thin fault-line up the face to the horizontal crack and finish directly above. (poor protection) Ray Morrissey. Paul Kavanagh GULLY CRACK 15m VS (4b) A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

            "description": "A further 20m or so up the gully, this route follows the obvious wide crack on the left-hand side of the giant rock pedestal where it meets the main face. The following climbs are found in a recessed area on a mainly clean but crack-riven face capped by a projecting triangular block. Scramble up grassy slopes to reach the climbs. FLYING DAGGERS 13m HS (4b) Start near the right-hand side of ledges in a corner beneath an overhang. Climb the shattered corner/crackline system past the overhang, finishing right of the projecting overhang. IMAGINING* 15m HVS (4c) Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top.

It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

            "description": "Start at a small overhanging recess. Climb the recess and slant up right near the edge before taking a direct line upwards, a little to the left of the shattered crack of Flying Daggers. The crux is rather bold and delicate. GALE ALLEY* 18m VS (4c) Starts below two parallel clefts. Go up via the right-hand cleft and slightly right to a very small niche. Continue up to finish at the projecting block. FULL TILT* 18m E1 (5b) Starts beneath the left-hand cleft, left of \"Gale Alley\". Climb the cleft and the overlap above it to a small niche directly above. Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully.

Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

Finish by climbing up direct or veering a little to the right. INSIDE EDGE 22m VS (4c) Starts in a slanting corner on the left side of the recessed slab. Clim past a small overhang and step right into a niche. Go up directly to finish. REMEMBRANCE 13m E1 (5b) Takes the narrow rounded slab left of \"Inside Edge\". Climb near the right-hand side of the slab, moving left near the top to finish. Bold, delicate climbing. J. Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab.

Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

Lyons, D. Wall, 2/9/01 ALIX 20m S (4a) Takes a cleaned crack to the left of the \"Remembrance\" slab. Climb this, trending leftwards onto a grassy ledge, beneath a large open crack. Continue up this to the ridge above. The following climbs are on the last clean slab reachable from the gully floor. PEPPA PIG** 20m E1 (5b) Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête.

Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one.

Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

            "description": "Obvious corner below the clean wall of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Good finger jamming, laybacking and bridging with some slab wobbling as well. Climb the right side of the slab to reach the hanging corner crack then climb that to the top. BABY SHARK* 25m E2 (5b) Loosely follows the arête formed by 2 slabs. Some interesting features and a bouldery crux. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. Arrange gear in the vertical corner at the right end of the ledge (which is surprisingly void of holds) then step up and left to gain a good hand hold in the thin crack close to the arête (crux). Pull up to good holds and a rest before stepping left round the arrete and following a slightly eliminate crack system to the top of the slab. GRANDMA SHARK 25m HVS (4c) Nice climbing that joins some interesting features but is ultimately escapable into RAMBLE for much of it's length. Start below and left of the left end of a large hanging grassy ledge. Climb a small overhang to gain the grassy ledge. From the leftmost end of the grassy ledge, make an easy but poorly protected move left onto the slab. Continue up the slab 1-2 meters from the arrete on the right. Eventually gear runs out so escape leftwards onto the obvious crack of RAMBLE and continue up that to the top. GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens.

Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall.

GRANDMA SHARK Variation 25m E1 (5a) Climb GRANDMA SHARK until the gear gets scarce but continue up the slab at the top for the final few meters instead of escaping leftwards. RAMBLE 30m HS (4a) An easy way to reach the ledge of Eye-eye and Tower Crack. Start on the blocky ledge as for Plinth then start up the left side of the slab until ½ height, taking care of some loose blocks in the corner. When the angle of the slab eases, gain the obvious cracks that lead up the center of the slab, finally topping out on the right hand side where it is easier to mantle onto the grassy ledge at the base of Tower Crack. From here it is possible (with care) to reach the final pitch of Great Gully Ridge by traversing right across the grassy ledges. PLINTH*** 30m VS (4c) An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

            "description": "An exciting pitch through some unlikely terrain. Start at the base of the clean slab shortly before the gully narrows and becomes impassible. Mantle onto a blocky ledge at the base of the slab then follow the obvious crack system up the middle of the slab until at 2/3rds height it is possible to move left to a detached flake on the front of the broken pillar of Obelisk. Impressive moves on good jugs lead up this flake then continue up the easier ground above to belay. From here it’s possible to traverse the steep grassy ledges with care to Left Crack, Right Crack or continue up Obelisk. The following climbs are found in the headwall area, in the upper reaches of Great Gully. They are described from left to right and are reached by carefully traversing in rightwards over vegetated ledges. WINDRUSH 23m HS (4b) Start to the left of the buttress beneath a series of clefts. Follow the cleft-line to ledges and move up to the left of the overhang to finish via a crack at jammed blocks. LEFT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start below and to the left of Windrush at a cracked rib of rock. Climb this, going slightly left to gain the left-hand crack which finishes on the right side of a rocking block. Go right to reach the base of an overhanging corner which is climbed on small holds to belay in a niche just below the cliff-top. RIGHT CRACK * 25m VS (4c) Start as for Left Crack but move over to the right-hand crack and climb it to the overhanging corner which is again surmounted as for Left Crack OBELISK ** 45m HVS (5a) This route is visible as a broken pillar of rock from the gully below it. Reach the start by further traversing down to the right of Right Crack to obvious clean cracks or by climbing Plinth from the gully below. Climb the cracks to a blocky ledge (beware loose blocks) and continue up over sound blocks to a crack going diagonally left across a wall. Work across left here and climb a steep cracked groove to a partial rest-point just below a square-cut ledge on the right. Gain this directly or traverse right to reach better holds before pulling up onto a short overhanging corner which is climbed as for Left Crack and Right Crack The next group of climbs are further right, on that section of the headwall directly behind the ridge above the recessed slab area. WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux).

WINK** 25m HVS (5a) Climb through the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall and proceed up the thin crack above. Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

Tend leftwards as you go up, using another thin crack and eventually the corner to the left. When the corner starts to get vegetated, it is possible to escape onto a ledge on the wall to the left. Protection for belaying at the top can be hard to find so it is recommended to carefully walk rightwards to the top of EYE-EYE and belay there. EYE-EYE*** 25m E2 (5b) Well protected climbing up the thin cracks in the clean wall left of the upper pitch of Great Gully Ridge. Twin ropes helpful. Start below the obvious triangular niche in the otherwise clean wall. Climb the obvious crack to gain the triangular niche then traverse right for 2-3 meters with feet at the height of the bottom of the niche until the next thin vertical crack can be reached. Climb this to the top on excellent wires and complicated fingerlocks. TOWER CRACK** 30m E1 (5b) Follows the right-hand crack in the steep wall forming the left flank of this section of the headwall. Climb the well-protected crack, moving left near the top, past a slight overhang to finish. CASTLES IN THE AIR* 40m E1 (5b) Moving left from the ridge below a frontal section of the headwall climb the obvious bulging crack to a ledge; Traverse left for 3m and climb ledges to a bulging corner crack. Climb this to an exciting airy finish (crux). HIGH IDEALS 40m HVS (5a) Climb the obvious bulging crack to the ledge as for Castles in the Air but then finish directly above to the right. HAKUNA MATATA** 40m E2 (5c) To the right of the obvious bulging crack is a smaller crack about 4m long. Climb this to the ledge above (good protection). Continue directly up to finish. The following route takes the steep arête-like ridge which forms the left side of Great Gully. PINNACLE RIDGE 150m HVS (4c) Not for the rock purist but nevertheless an interesting and sometimes demanding challenge on rock and heather up this steep, arête-like ridge. The route follows the crest of the ridge and climbs the main obstacles directly. It starts at a steep wall behind a tree and climbs the wall directly which is difficult and poorly protected at the top. The next major rock obstacle is taken partly on the right, going up and over a large rocking block. Rather easier but pleasant climbing on good rock towards the top of the ridge with panoramic views. ====BARAVORE VALLEY (LOWER)==== ALDER BUTTRESS is the first buttress reached, to the left of the tree-filled gully. ALDER AMBLER 39m VS (4b,4b) Start at the lowest point of the buttress, on the left-hand side, below a crack slanting up right. 1. 24m Climb the crack to a ledge, pull up onto a block and move across and up left to a ledge on the edge of the slab. Gain a higher ledge and climb a short steep wall to the foot of a deep crack which splits the upper slab. Strenuous moves gain the crack which is followed to a wide ledge and thread belay. 2. 15m Move left and climb the wide crack running up to the right of the overhang, difficulty increases with height SNOWFLAKES * 40m HVS (5a,4c) Although escapable at several points it gives enjoyable climbing. Start 2m left of Alder Ambler, below a thin dogleg crack running up the right-hand edge of the steep face. 1. 25m Climb the crack to a ledge, traverse horizontally left for 2m and make a difficult move up to gain a short slanting crack (crux). Move left again and pull up into the slanting corner. Leave the corner by hand traversing out left from beneath the overhang and pull up into a small triangular cave. Make an awkward move out right to gain a ledge at the base of the upper slab. Delicate moves lead up the left edge to a wide ledge and belay. 2. 15m Follow the left edge of blocks to a stance below the left side of a short hanging slab. Hand traverse left along the lip of the slab and pull around into a niche. Easier climbing to the top. Variation: Direct Start 23m HVS (5b)1a Starting midway between Snowflakes and Alder Statesman climb directly up the wall via the short, thin vertical crack to gain the sloping crack of Snowflakes. Snowflakes - direct start. ALDER STATESMAN * 36m VS (4c,4b) Start 3m left of Snowflakes, below the overhang.1. 21m Climb the cracks to the overhang. Move across left to gain the foot of a flake below the cave. Climb the flake and traverse left along the wide zig-zag crack to exit by a projecting block. 2. 15m Follow the wide crack to a ledge below and right of the overhang. Step left onto the slab and pull directly over the overhang on good holds. CRACK AND SLAB 25m HS (4b) Start 5m up left of Snowflakes and just left of a large rowantree growing against the face. Climb the cracks and exit by aprojecting block onto a wide ledge. Climb the edge of the blocks to a stance below and left of the hanging slab. Makea delicate move up left onto the slab and climb the crack above. The next two climbs are on ROWAN BUTTRESS to the left of and at right-angles to Alder Buttress. ROWAN ROOFS 27m VS (4c) Start at the bottom right of the buttress, in a corner below a series of overhangs and 4m above a large rowan tree.The first three overhangs are taken on the left, the fourth by a short lay-back crack. Above this step right and climb a thin crack to a ledge. A shallow corner and a block lead to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. ROWAN ARÊTE * 27m HVS (5a) Start at the bottom left of the buttress, beside a conifer, below and left of a rowan growing above an overhang.Pull up right onto a block, climb a short crack and a flake to gain a crack running up the left side of the arête. Follow the crack until it is possible to step right onto the arête and move up to a ledge. Difficult moves lead to a higher ledge at the foot of a short, steep section capped by an overhang. Climb the edge on small holds (crux), step right and jam up the crack which splits the overhang. A difficult mantelshelf is followed by easier climbing to a grassy bay with a short pillar and good belays. The next five climbs are on HOLLY BUTTRESS which is to the left of, and around the corner from, Rowan Buttress. A large holly tree grows in a corner at its base. SAVAGE SAGA 28m VS (4c) Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

            "description": "Start 3m right of the holly tree, on a heather ledge below an overhang and just left of a small rowan tree.Climb a short left-trending ramp to reach a horizontal finger crack and traverse back right above the overhang. Delicate moves gain the upper slab and lead with continuing delicacy up its left edge to a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and step onto the slightly overhanging wall. Steep climbing leads to a strenuous exit. ROGHA NA COILLE * 28m VS (4b) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a sloping ledge and pull up onto a detached block. Continue pleasantly up the corner with some difficult moves near the top. FIRST TREE OF THE GREENWOOD 19m VS (4c) Start just left of the holly tree. Climb a flake and traverse right into the corner behind the tree. Climb this corner to a good ledge below the shallow, overhanging scoop. Climb this (crux) and the short wall above. DECK THE HALLS * 19m HVS (5a) Start 3m left of the holly tree, just below and right of three rowan trees, at the foot of a thin crack. Steep climbing leads to a good ledge where the crack widens. Continue pleasantly up the crack to the overhang, surmount this (crux) and continue more easily to the top. GREENLANDIC 23m S (4a) Start 3m left of Deck The Halls at the foot of the highest of the three rowan trees. 1. 13m Traverse rightwards to reach a sloping ledge behind the holly tree. Pull up onto a detached block and move across right to belay at the foot of the slab with an overhang on its left. 2. 10m Climb the slab - difficult to start and delicate to finish. The next two climbs are on FRAUGHAN BUTTRESS which is about 15m left of the top of Holly Buttress. A rowan tree grows at its foot and another at the base of an obvious deep chimney. FRAUGHAN CHIMNEY 12m VD Start at the small rowan tree at the foot of the buttress. Move up right to a ledge with a second rowan. Squeeze into the narrow chimney and climb it, moving left above to belay on the highest ledge. FRAUGHAN ARÊTE 12m VS (4b) Takes the arête between the previous route and the next one. FRAUGHAN WALL 11m HS (4a) Start as for Fraughan Chimney. Climb the corner to the left of the arête until it is possible to pull up into the grassy niche on the wall. Steep climbing on good holds leads via the jammed block to a belay as for the chimney. There is one final route in Barravore Valley on the opposite (south-east) side of the valley on the steep rocky buttress which descends leftwards, west of Art's Lough. ENTERPRISE 100m VD Takes a central line up the buttress to the left of a shallow, grassy gully. ===CARRAIGMILLER=== A newly developed steep crag with lots of potential for new routes. 30 mins walk from the Hostel. https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Pq7XiG9VgNJx4H46 Main Crag"

FAST MOVER &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4c) A rising traverse from bottom left to top right of the buttress. The main difficulties are short-lived. Start at the bottom groove of Egg Timer. Move up diagonally right to a ledge at the base of the blue/grey groove of Extra Terrestrial. Move up to a small ledge halfway up the groove on its right side. Climb up diagonally right past the slight bulge on thin holds (crux); continue more easily, crossing the block near the top of Gonzo's Green Gully and traverse the wall beyond this to its top right-hand corner. HONORARY ALTNADUE CRACK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4b) Start at thin crack between Egg Timer and Curving Cracks. Climb the thin crack directly for 10m (small wires useful) and then finish up the left edge of the buttress as for Curving Cracks. OWN RISK ACCEPTED&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4b Starts in the little alcove separating Curving Crack and Honorary Altnadue Crack. Staying in the centre of the alcove , put the blinkers on and go straight up to the junction of Curving Cracks and the ledge at the top of Egg Timer; continue up the left edge to the top. CURVING CRACKS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4a) Start at the obvious curving crack right of Egg Timer. Climb this and continue up the front left edge of the buttress to the top. EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HVS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5a) Takes a direct line between Curving Cracks and the direct crack line of Gardener's World. Climb the short wall for 3 - 4m to gain a groove. Climb straight up this on very small holds (crux) to better holds and then climb the steep wall above to the top. GARDENER'S WORLD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4b) Follow the obvious crack to the right of Extra-Terrestrial directly to the top.

GONZO'S GREEN GULLY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4a) Climb the obvious chimney groove that splits the face under the large overhang. At the top of the chimney exit left to turn the overhang. SKYWALKER* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4c) Start 2m to the right of Gonzo's Green Gully. Climb the left side of the recessed slab to Terrace Ledge. Continue diagonally up the slab to where the roof meets Gonzo's Green Gully. By means of a wide bridging move and a strenuous pull-up gain the steep wall above and then climb directly to the top. GUILTY FEET *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5c/6a) Start as for Dagwood's Detour. Go straight up the thin crack in the centre of the recessed slab to Terrace Ledge and directly over a bulge to the centre of the roof. The crux is in surmounting the roof (in situ peg for protection). Finish directly up the wall above. DAGWOOD'S DETOUR*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HVS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5a) Climb the thin crack in the centre of the recessed slab to Terrace Ledge. Continue directly up over a bulge to the centre of the roof. Traverse right until it is possible to move up onto the wall above. Move back left above the overhang and climb the wall directly to the top. CONNELLY'S CONUNDRUM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4b) Climb the right-hand side of the recessed slab to the base of the obvious detached pillar, on the left of which is a crack.

Step up onto the slab and traverse right until it is possible to gain the arête. Ascend the slab above, bearing left and by-passing a heather patch near the slab's left edge before finishing up on better holds. EXCITABLE BOY ** 15m E4 (6a) Takes the flake crack which splits the bulging wall to the left of Little Oak Crack. Start below an overhanging gully with jammed blocks. Traverse out right on the diagonal crack to a rest-point where this crack joins another crack passing up leftwards through the bulging wall. Climb this by determined lay-backing to bigger finishing holds. LITTLE OAK CRACK ** 15m E1 (5b) Start about 5m right of Excitable Boy and on the left side of a white wall below an undercut crack with a very small tree. Make a strenuous start to gain the crack and the niche above. Muscle up past a small overhang and the tree to a resting place on the left. Finish up the crack on the right. Well protected. LITTLE OAK DIRECT ** 15m E4 (6b) Takes the upper impending bulge to the right of the normal finish of Little Oak Crack. SURFS UP *** 15m E4 (6a) Brilliant technical climbing up the hanging groove to the right of Little Oak Crack. Start 2-3m right of Little Oak Crack below the white wall and just left of a cave. Climb up to a hidden peg runner at a large flat hold. Move out right to a flake and a peg runner. Step back left into the groove and finish strenuously up this. Tree belay on the right. The following five climbs are on the south face of the buttress. SQUALL * 15m E1 (5b) Start beneath a hanging groove on the dark south face. From the top of a very large block move leftwards with bold deliberation in an exposed situation onto the arête and strenuously gain the groove above. Follow this more comfortably to the holly tree belay. JET STREAM * 15m E1 (5b) Start as for Squall. Climb the hanging groove and the arête above to the finish. LIGHTNING CRACK ** 15m E2 (5c) Starts 2m right of Squall on the block ledge below a zig-zag finger crack. Follow the strenuous crack slightly leftwards until better holds around a small sloping ledge are reached. Finish up the short cracks leftwards to the arête and the tree belay. ARCHAOS *** 18m E6 (6b) This route boasts the steepest climbing in Wicklow with well protected cranking on perfect granite. Start as for Lightning Crack. Follow Lightning Crack for 2m to a letterbox jug. Move a little to the right before pushing on up to a good rest and a peg-runner shared with Storm Cloud in the horizontal black fault-line undercutting the white rock above. Traverse right for a metre to a good side-pull and then make a tricky move to gain the base of an overhanging groove. Climb this (crux) past a peg runner to an even steeper finish in a wild position. Move down and left to belay at the tree or finish directly up the slab. STORM CLOUD ** 16m E3 (6a) Takes the flake fault-line diagonally leftwards across the wall. Start a few metres right of Lightning Crack and follow the fault-line past a peg-runner to another peg-runner in the horizontal undercut (shared with Archaos). Go past a slight bulge and finish up the wide left-slanting crack just right of the finish of Lightning Cracks. Belay at the holly tree. The next group of climbs are found on the more featureless but less steep east face. The climbing is not as strenuous but is quite thin and delicate in places and requires some careful route-finding. SIDEWINDER ** 35m E1 (5b/c) Essentially a rising traverse climbing the east face from bottom left to top right. Start on a grassy patch on the lowest point of the face.Climb the centre of the wall to a horizontal crack at about 5m. From here take a slightly rising line rightwards (crux) to a long white streak just above a small turf ledge. Continue rightwards to a large hidden stance and follow a right-trending crack before going straight up, passing tree branches with dexterity. DECEPTION ** 30m E2 (5c) An excellent wall climb which starts as for Sidewinder. Follow Sidewinder to the horizontal break and then diagonally right to the base of the obvious long white streak rising from the turf ledge. Follow the streak straight up to an undercut horizontal joint just below the arête. Traverse right for 6m to a large hidden ledge in the centre of the wall. From the middle of the ledge follow a crack to a good flake hold. From here trend left to a good stance on the arête left of a small black overlap. DUPLICITY * 35m E2 (5c, 4a) The crux is short but demanding nonetheless. 1. 20m Start as for Sidewinder which is followed to the horizontal crack. Continue straight up to undercut horizontal joints which intersect the arête. Move out left onto the arête at this point and follow it for about 6 - 7m to a good belay. 2. 15m Continue up to the top in a pleasant situation near the right-hand edge. TOMAHAWK * 35m E1 (5b, 4a) Starts just right of Sidewinder at a short corner. 1. 20m Climb up slightly right to below the peaty ledge and then work out left and up past a bulge on thin holds (crux). Move back right and follow the white streak to just below the small overhang and an obvious lead out left to an arête. Belay a metre or so up the arête. 2. 15m Continue up the right edge of the slab to the top. ====OTHER BUTTRESSES==== A number of other buttresses are scattered along the hillside to the west and east of the Main Buttress. These are described from west to east, starting with the only buttress to the west. This is a steep triangular slab on the edge of the flood-plain, directly behind the ruins of a long-abandoned farmstead and about 500m west of the Main Buttress. The rock is clean and sound. Descent is easy via a ramp to the side of the slab. Ring bolts, useful for belaying, were installed on top of the buttress but have since been hammered flat DRAGONFLY 15m VS (4c) Takes the diagonal crack leading up right to the horizontal break line. Climb the crack and slab to the break and finish by either the crack leading up to the left or directly up the final slab. HEATHER BEE 15m HS (4b) Follow the quartz edge sloping up right to the edge of the slab. Alternatively start 1 - 2m further right and climb directly to the mid-height ledge. OASIS 17m HS (4b) Takes a direct line up the centre of the slab, starting several metres right of the quartz edge and finishing just right of same. BLUEBELL FAREWELL 22m S (4a) A rising traverse starting just left of the niche and following a crack-line diagonally left across the face. Near the top step up onto the slab above the crack and finish directly. DENIZENS OF OLD 18m VS (4c) Starts at a niche on the right-hand side of the slab. Climb leftwards out of the niche onto the slab and up to the two parallel quartz seams. Follow the left-hand one to a bulge and gain a slanting crack above below the final edge; up this to finish. NEW KID ON THE BLOCK\" 18m HVS(5a) Start as for Denizens of Old up to base of the two parallel quartz seams (moving up Bluebell Farewell makes it possible to place side runners before returning to this point). Tiptoe up by the right-hand seam to reach a horizontal break. Stand comfortably on this before launching up the featureless slab and arete to the top. DANCING WITH EXCITEMENT * 20m HVS (5a) Gain a small foot-ledge right of the niche and move diagonally up left via a slanting edge to the right-hand quartz seam. Work out right along an edge-line to the arête (crux). Finish up the arête. About 50m to the right or east of the Main Buttress and just above a copse there is a large, partly vegetated broken buttress area, the left flank of which has yielded some routes. The next two climbs are found on the bottom left side of this buttress, directly opposite the Main Buttress and just above the copse. SKEDADDLE 14m HS (4b) Start on a ledge below an obvious ramp on the left side of the overhanging outcrop. Climb the ramp and pass blocks carefully to reach an overhanging corner which is surmounted (crux) to finish. DOGPATCH * 21m VS (4a,4c) 1. 13m Start 2m right of Skedaddle on a ledge by a holly bush. Gain the large V-shaped notch, move left and exit onto the large ledge via cracks and flakes. 2. 8m Use large handholds to surmount the roof near its left side. The following route is found on a small rock face just right of the Main Buttress and to the left of the copse. UPWARDLY MOBILE * 10m E1 (5c) Takes a central line on the face and has the character of an extended boulder problem and is harder than it looks. Climb the thin crack in the steep slab directly to the ledge. Move slightly right and surmount the short wall Further up the gully there are some climbs on a holly-clad buttress which are described from right to left. SAFE HAVEN 30m HVS (5a, 4b) Starts about 40m up the gully from Skeddadle below a narrow, left-edged slab. 1. 10m Climb the slab boldly to a furze ledge below the steep holly buttress. 2. 18m Gain a short wall on the left, moving up right to a ledge; up a quartz-rich wall to a stance and surmount a tricky wall above to finish. HEAVEN CAN WAIT * 18m VS (4c) Start below a leftward slanting, bow-shaped crack and climb to a stance. Finish up the slabby wall behind the trees. SHADOWLAND 18m VS (4c) Start below a right-facing corner. Climb up and traverse right at the top to a stance. Move left behind the trees and take a short, wide crack followed by an awkward step to finish. Thread belay well back. LOOK OUT 18m VS (4c) Start below a short wall just left of the corner of Shadowland. Climb the short wall to the right of the thin crack-line, with the help of holds on the arête, to the holly tree. Continue up by a holly tree on the left passing a projecting block to below a slight overhang. Surmount this by moving up left before exiting to the right of the large boulder. The next area of climbing interest is found alongside a large shallow gully about 200m to the right or east of the Main Buttress. There are two routes on a triangular buttress right of the gully. AVALON DREAM ** 20m HVS (4c) An enjoyable route which essentially follows the arête on the left-hand side of the buttress. Start below a short green niche, right of the gully. Gain the groove and follow the left-trending crack above it for some distance before gaining the steep slab on the right. Follow the left edge of the slab to the top. A COLD WINTER'S DAY 25m VS (4c) Start right of the gully below a short wall with a righttrending crack. Climb the crack with an awkward exit right onto a wide ledge (possible belay). Continue up the wall above to a small niche; gain height to a sloping heathery ledge and up on good holds towards the arête on the right which is gained near its highest point for the best finish. About 10m up from the start of Avalon Dream past a heathery rake there is a steep narrow face where the next route is found. HONEY BEE 12m HS (4b) Climb the face for about 5m to its right-hand edge and follow the edge past some blocks at the top to finish. Some 50m up and left of the gully from the Avalon Dream buttress there is a broken, overhanging buttress on which there are two climbs. TURNING POINT 20m HVS (5a) Start at a niche on the front right of the buttress. Up right onto a ledge below a roof. Move out precariously onto an exposed edge and then up to become established in a wide crack. Continue up directly, passing to the left of the roof before gaining easier ground. EMBOLDENED 15m VS (4c) Start on the right-hand side of the buttress at a rock pillar. Climb the pillar and with difficulty gain a slabby corner above the overhang. Move up and out right to gain a short groove. Climb past the roof on its right side to finish. A little further to the right along the hillside there is a prominent broken rock ridge with a brown-coloured slab at its base and a projecting rock nose near the top. The following route takes a line up this ridge. PROW BUTTRESS RIDGE 125m VS (4c, 4b, 4c, 4b) Although somewhat disjointed the route offers a series of interesting problems and a perhaps unexpected sense of exposure near the top. Start at the brown slab at the bottom left of the ill-defined ridge. 1. 15m From the centre of the slab move up diagonally left past a series of horizontal breaks to the top left of the slab. 2. 30m Move right over grassy ground to the base of the ridge proper. Climb a slab towards some projecting blocks and pull past these before scrambling to a belay at a rowan tree. 3. 35m Move up a short steep slab behind the tree and then an easy-angled slab to a short chimney corner. Up this with difficulty and continue on for 10-15m to a block belay. 4. 45m Continue up the steepening slab, traversing out below the rock nose to a short overhanging corner with a jammed block. Climb this with an awkward exit and continue up a short wide crack to the right of a large block, finishing directly to the top. Four routes start on the Prow at the top of the previous route. The difficulties are rather short-lived but the rock is clean and there are some exciting moments. SHOOTING STAR 12m HS (4b) Start to the left of the Prow at a steep corner. Climb this and the easier ground above it. FALLEN ANGELS 15m HS (4b) Start to the right of the corner, moving out right below the roof to gain a ledge. Finish up the cleft. THE MILKY WAY 15m VS (5a) Follow the quartz vein to the ledge and up the arête on the left. BLUE HEAVEN * 20m HVS (5b) Start at the quartz vein but move out right in a precarious situation to gain an obvious slanting edge and thence reach the ledge above. Move back left and finish up to the right of the arête. <display_map> </display_map>"

            "description": "Takes the flake crack which splits the bulging wall to the left of Little Oak Crack. Start below an overhanging gully with jammed blocks. Traverse out right on the diagonal crack to a rest-point where this crack joins another crack passing up leftwards through the bulging wall. Climb this by determined lay-backing to bigger finishing holds. LITTLE OAK CRACK ** 15m E1 (5b) Start about 5m right of Excitable Boy and on the left side of a white wall below an undercut crack with a very small tree. Make a strenuous start to gain the crack and the niche above. Muscle up past a small overhang and the tree to a resting place on the left. Finish up the crack on the right. Well protected. LITTLE OAK DIRECT ** 15m E4 (6b) Takes the upper impending bulge to the right of the normal finish of Little Oak Crack. SURFS UP *** 15m E4 (6a) Brilliant technical climbing up the hanging groove to the right of Little Oak Crack. Start 2-3m right of Little Oak Crack below the white wall and just left of a cave. Climb up to a hidden peg runner at a large flat hold. Move out right to a flake and a peg runner. Step back left into the groove and finish strenuously up this. Tree belay on the right. The following five climbs are on the south face of the buttress. SQUALL * 15m E1 (5b) Start beneath a hanging groove on the dark south face. From the top of a very large block move leftwards with bold deliberation in an exposed situation onto the arête and strenuously gain the groove above. Follow this more comfortably to the holly tree belay. JET STREAM * 15m E1 (5b) Start as for Squall. Climb the hanging groove and the arête above to the finish. LIGHTNING CRACK ** 15m E2 (5c) Starts 2m right of Squall on the block ledge below a zig-zag finger crack. Follow the strenuous crack slightly leftwards until better holds around a small sloping ledge are reached. Finish up the short cracks leftwards to the arête and the tree belay. ARCHAOS *** 18m E6 (6b) This route boasts the steepest climbing in Wicklow with well protected cranking on perfect granite. Start as for Lightning Crack. Follow Lightning Crack for 2m to a letterbox jug. Move a little to the right before pushing on up to a good rest and a peg-runner shared with Storm Cloud in the horizontal black fault-line undercutting the white rock above. Traverse right for a metre to a good side-pull and then make a tricky move to gain the base of an overhanging groove. Climb this (crux) past a peg runner to an even steeper finish in a wild position. Move down and left to belay at the tree or finish directly up the slab. STORM CLOUD ** 16m E3 (6a) Takes the flake fault-line diagonally leftwards across the wall. Start a few metres right of Lightning Crack and follow the fault-line past a peg-runner to another peg-runner in the horizontal undercut (shared with Archaos). Go past a slight bulge and finish up the wide left-slanting crack just right of the finish of Lightning Cracks. Belay at the holly tree. The next group of climbs are found on the more featureless but less steep east face. The climbing is not as strenuous but is quite thin and delicate in places and requires some careful route-finding. SIDEWINDER ** 35m E1 (5b/c) Essentially a rising traverse climbing the east face from bottom left to top right. Start on a grassy patch on the lowest point of the face.Climb the centre of the wall to a horizontal crack at about 5m. From here take a slightly rising line rightwards (crux) to a long white streak just above a small turf ledge. Continue rightwards to a large hidden stance and follow a right-trending crack before going straight up, passing tree branches with dexterity. DECEPTION ** 30m E2 (5c) An excellent wall climb which starts as for Sidewinder. Follow Sidewinder to the horizontal break and then diagonally right to the base of the obvious long white streak rising from the turf ledge. Follow the streak straight up to an undercut horizontal joint just below the arête. Traverse right for 6m to a large hidden ledge in the centre of the wall. From the middle of the ledge follow a crack to a good flake hold. From here trend left to a good stance on the arête left of a small black overlap. DUPLICITY * 35m E2 (5c, 4a) The crux is short but demanding nonetheless. 1. 20m Start as for Sidewinder which is followed to the horizontal crack. Continue straight up to undercut horizontal joints which intersect the arête. Move out left onto the arête at this point and follow it for about 6 - 7m to a good belay. 2. 15m Continue up to the top in a pleasant situation near the right-hand edge. TOMAHAWK * 35m E1 (5b, 4a) Starts just right of Sidewinder at a short corner. 1. 20m Climb up slightly right to below the peaty ledge and then work out left and up past a bulge on thin holds (crux). Move back right and follow the white streak to just below the small overhang and an obvious lead out left to an arête. Belay a metre or so up the arête. 2. 15m Continue up the right edge of the slab to the top. ====OTHER BUTTRESSES==== A number of other buttresses are scattered along the hillside to the west and east of the Main Buttress. These are described from west to east, starting with the only buttress to the west. This is a steep triangular slab on the edge of the flood-plain, directly behind the ruins of a long-abandoned farmstead and about 500m west of the Main Buttress. The rock is clean and sound. Descent is easy via a ramp to the side of the slab. Ring bolts, useful for belaying, were installed on top of the buttress but have since been hammered flat DRAGONFLY 15m VS (4c) Takes the diagonal crack leading up right to the horizontal break line. Climb the crack and slab to the break and finish by either the crack leading up to the left or directly up the final slab. HEATHER BEE 15m HS (4b) Follow the quartz edge sloping up right to the edge of the slab. Alternatively start 1 - 2m further right and climb directly to the mid-height ledge. OASIS 17m HS (4b) Takes a direct line up the centre of the slab, starting several metres right of the quartz edge and finishing just right of same. BLUEBELL FAREWELL 22m S (4a) A rising traverse starting just left of the niche and following a crack-line diagonally left across the face. Near the top step up onto the slab above the crack and finish directly. DENIZENS OF OLD 18m VS (4c) Starts at a niche on the right-hand side of the slab. Climb leftwards out of the niche onto the slab and up to the two parallel quartz seams. Follow the left-hand one to a bulge and gain a slanting crack above below the final edge; up this to finish. NEW KID ON THE BLOCK\" 18m HVS(5a) Start as for Denizens of Old up to base of the two parallel quartz seams (moving up Bluebell Farewell makes it possible to place side runners before returning to this point). Tiptoe up by the right-hand seam to reach a horizontal break. Stand comfortably on this before launching up the featureless slab and arete to the top. DANCING WITH EXCITEMENT * 20m HVS (5a) Gain a small foot-ledge right of the niche and move diagonally up left via a slanting edge to the right-hand quartz seam. Work out right along an edge-line to the arête (crux). Finish up the arête. About 50m to the right or east of the Main Buttress and just above a copse there is a large, partly vegetated broken buttress area, the left flank of which has yielded some routes. The next two climbs are found on the bottom left side of this buttress, directly opposite the Main Buttress and just above the copse. SKEDADDLE 14m HS (4b) Start on a ledge below an obvious ramp on the left side of the overhanging outcrop. Climb the ramp and pass blocks carefully to reach an overhanging corner which is surmounted (crux) to finish. DOGPATCH * 21m VS (4a,4c) 1. 13m Start 2m right of Skedaddle on a ledge by a holly bush. Gain the large V-shaped notch, move left and exit onto the large ledge via cracks and flakes. 2. 8m Use large handholds to surmount the roof near its left side. The following route is found on a small rock face just right of the Main Buttress and to the left of the copse. UPWARDLY MOBILE * 10m E1 (5c) Takes a central line on the face and has the character of an extended boulder problem and is harder than it looks. Climb the thin crack in the steep slab directly to the ledge. Move slightly right and surmount the short wall Further up the gully there are some climbs on a holly-clad buttress which are described from right to left. SAFE HAVEN 30m HVS (5a, 4b) Starts about 40m up the gully from Skeddadle below a narrow, left-edged slab. 1. 10m Climb the slab boldly to a furze ledge below the steep holly buttress. 2. 18m Gain a short wall on the left, moving up right to a ledge; up a quartz-rich wall to a stance and surmount a tricky wall above to finish. HEAVEN CAN WAIT * 18m VS (4c) Start below a leftward slanting, bow-shaped crack and climb to a stance. Finish up the slabby wall behind the trees. SHADOWLAND 18m VS (4c) Start below a right-facing corner. Climb up and traverse right at the top to a stance. Move left behind the trees and take a short, wide crack followed by an awkward step to finish. Thread belay well back. LOOK OUT 18m VS (4c) Start below a short wall just left of the corner of Shadowland. Climb the short wall to the right of the thin crack-line, with the help of holds on the arête, to the holly tree. Continue up by a holly tree on the left passing a projecting block to below a slight overhang. Surmount this by moving up left before exiting to the right of the large boulder. The next area of climbing interest is found alongside a large shallow gully about 200m to the right or east of the Main Buttress. There are two routes on a triangular buttress right of the gully. AVALON DREAM ** 20m HVS (4c) An enjoyable route which essentially follows the arête on the left-hand side of the buttress. Start below a short green niche, right of the gully. Gain the groove and follow the left-trending crack above it for some distance before gaining the steep slab on the right. Follow the left edge of the slab to the top. A COLD WINTER'S DAY 25m VS (4c) Start right of the gully below a short wall with a righttrending crack. Climb the crack with an awkward exit right onto a wide ledge (possible belay).

            "description": "Takes the upper impending bulge to the right of the normal finish of Little Oak Crack. SURFS UP *** 15m E4 (6a) Brilliant technical climbing up the hanging groove to the right of Little Oak Crack. Start 2-3m right of Little Oak Crack below the white wall and just left of a cave. Climb up to a hidden peg runner at a large flat hold. Move out right to a flake and a peg runner. Step back left into the groove and finish strenuously up this. Tree belay on the right. The following five climbs are on the south face of the buttress. SQUALL * 15m E1 (5b) Start beneath a hanging groove on the dark south face. From the top of a very large block move leftwards with bold deliberation in an exposed situation onto the arête and strenuously gain the groove above. Follow this more comfortably to the holly tree belay. JET STREAM * 15m E1 (5b) Start as for Squall. Climb the hanging groove and the arête above to the finish. LIGHTNING CRACK ** 15m E2 (5c) Starts 2m right of Squall on the block ledge below a zig-zag finger crack. Follow the strenuous crack slightly leftwards until better holds around a small sloping ledge are reached. Finish up the short cracks leftwards to the arête and the tree belay. ARCHAOS *** 18m E6 (6b) This route boasts the steepest climbing in Wicklow with well protected cranking on perfect granite. Start as for Lightning Crack. Follow Lightning Crack for 2m to a letterbox jug. Move a little to the right before pushing on up to a good rest and a peg-runner shared with Storm Cloud in the horizontal black fault-line undercutting the white rock above. Traverse right for a metre to a good side-pull and then make a tricky move to gain the base of an overhanging groove. Climb this (crux) past a peg runner to an even steeper finish in a wild position. Move down and left to belay at the tree or finish directly up the slab. STORM CLOUD ** 16m E3 (6a) Takes the flake fault-line diagonally leftwards across the wall. Start a few metres right of Lightning Crack and follow the fault-line past a peg-runner to another peg-runner in the horizontal undercut (shared with Archaos). Go past a slight bulge and finish up the wide left-slanting crack just right of the finish of Lightning Cracks. Belay at the holly tree. The next group of climbs are found on the more featureless but less steep east face. The climbing is not as strenuous but is quite thin and delicate in places and requires some careful route-finding. SIDEWINDER ** 35m E1 (5b/c) Essentially a rising traverse climbing the east face from bottom left to top right. Start on a grassy patch on the lowest point of the face.Climb the centre of the wall to a horizontal crack at about 5m. From here take a slightly rising line rightwards (crux) to a long white streak just above a small turf ledge. Continue rightwards to a large hidden stance and follow a right-trending crack before going straight up, passing tree branches with dexterity. DECEPTION ** 30m E2 (5c) An excellent wall climb which starts as for Sidewinder. Follow Sidewinder to the horizontal break and then diagonally right to the base of the obvious long white streak rising from the turf ledge. Follow the streak straight up to an undercut horizontal joint just below the arête. Traverse right for 6m to a large hidden ledge in the centre of the wall. From the middle of the ledge follow a crack to a good flake hold. From here trend left to a good stance on the arête left of a small black overlap. DUPLICITY * 35m E2 (5c, 4a) The crux is short but demanding nonetheless. 1. 20m Start as for Sidewinder which is followed to the horizontal crack. Continue straight up to undercut horizontal joints which intersect the arête. Move out left onto the arête at this point and follow it for about 6 - 7m to a good belay. 2. 15m Continue up to the top in a pleasant situation near the right-hand edge. TOMAHAWK * 35m E1 (5b, 4a) Starts just right of Sidewinder at a short corner. 1. 20m Climb up slightly right to below the peaty ledge and then work out left and up past a bulge on thin holds (crux). Move back right and follow the white streak to just below the small overhang and an obvious lead out left to an arête. Belay a metre or so up the arête. 2. 15m Continue up the right edge of the slab to the top. ====OTHER BUTTRESSES==== A number of other buttresses are scattered along the hillside to the west and east of the Main Buttress. These are described from west to east, starting with the only buttress to the west. This is a steep triangular slab on the edge of the flood-plain, directly behind the ruins of a long-abandoned farmstead and about 500m west of the Main Buttress. The rock is clean and sound. Descent is easy via a ramp to the side of the slab. Ring bolts, useful for belaying, were installed on top of the buttress but have since been hammered flat DRAGONFLY 15m VS (4c) Takes the diagonal crack leading up right to the horizontal break line. Climb the crack and slab to the break and finish by either the crack leading up to the left or directly up the final slab. HEATHER BEE 15m HS (4b) Follow the quartz edge sloping up right to the edge of the slab. Alternatively start 1 - 2m further right and climb directly to the mid-height ledge. OASIS 17m HS (4b) Takes a direct line up the centre of the slab, starting several metres right of the quartz edge and finishing just right of same. BLUEBELL FAREWELL 22m S (4a) A rising traverse starting just left of the niche and following a crack-line diagonally left across the face. Near the top step up onto the slab above the crack and finish directly. DENIZENS OF OLD 18m VS (4c) Starts at a niche on the right-hand side of the slab. Climb leftwards out of the niche onto the slab and up to the two parallel quartz seams. Follow the left-hand one to a bulge and gain a slanting crack above below the final edge; up this to finish. NEW KID ON THE BLOCK\" 18m HVS(5a) Start as for Denizens of Old up to base of the two parallel quartz seams (moving up Bluebell Farewell makes it possible to place side runners before returning to this point). Tiptoe up by the right-hand seam to reach a horizontal break. Stand comfortably on this before launching up the featureless slab and arete to the top. DANCING WITH EXCITEMENT * 20m HVS (5a) Gain a small foot-ledge right of the niche and move diagonally up left via a slanting edge to the right-hand quartz seam. Work out right along an edge-line to the arête (crux). Finish up the arête. About 50m to the right or east of the Main Buttress and just above a copse there is a large, partly vegetated broken buttress area, the left flank of which has yielded some routes. The next two climbs are found on the bottom left side of this buttress, directly opposite the Main Buttress and just above the copse. SKEDADDLE 14m HS (4b) Start on a ledge below an obvious ramp on the left side of the overhanging outcrop. Climb the ramp and pass blocks carefully to reach an overhanging corner which is surmounted (crux) to finish. DOGPATCH * 21m VS (4a,4c) 1. 13m Start 2m right of Skedaddle on a ledge by a holly bush. Gain the large V-shaped notch, move left and exit onto the large ledge via cracks and flakes. 2. 8m Use large handholds to surmount the roof near its left side. The following route is found on a small rock face just right of the Main Buttress and to the left of the copse. UPWARDLY MOBILE * 10m E1 (5c) Takes a central line on the face and has the character of an extended boulder problem and is harder than it looks. Climb the thin crack in the steep slab directly to the ledge. Move slightly right and surmount the short wall Further up the gully there are some climbs on a holly-clad buttress which are described from right to left. SAFE HAVEN 30m HVS (5a, 4b) Starts about 40m up the gully from Skeddadle below a narrow, left-edged slab. 1. 10m Climb the slab boldly to a furze ledge below the steep holly buttress. 2. 18m Gain a short wall on the left, moving up right to a ledge; up a quartz-rich wall to a stance and surmount a tricky wall above to finish. HEAVEN CAN WAIT * 18m VS (4c) Start below a leftward slanting, bow-shaped crack and climb to a stance. Finish up the slabby wall behind the trees. SHADOWLAND 18m VS (4c) Start below a right-facing corner. Climb up and traverse right at the top to a stance. Move left behind the trees and take a short, wide crack followed by an awkward step to finish. Thread belay well back. LOOK OUT 18m VS (4c) Start below a short wall just left of the corner of Shadowland. Climb the short wall to the right of the thin crack-line, with the help of holds on the arête, to the holly tree. Continue up by a holly tree on the left passing a projecting block to below a slight overhang. Surmount this by moving up left before exiting to the right of the large boulder. The next area of climbing interest is found alongside a large shallow gully about 200m to the right or east of the Main Buttress. There are two routes on a triangular buttress right of the gully. AVALON DREAM ** 20m HVS (4c) An enjoyable route which essentially follows the arête on the left-hand side of the buttress. Start below a short green niche, right of the gully. Gain the groove and follow the left-trending crack above it for some distance before gaining the steep slab on the right. Follow the left edge of the slab to the top. A COLD WINTER'S DAY 25m VS (4c) Start right of the gully below a short wall with a righttrending crack. Climb the crack with an awkward exit right onto a wide ledge (possible belay). Continue up the wall above to a small niche; gain height to a sloping heathery ledge and up on good holds towards the arête on the right which is gained near its highest point for the best finish. About 10m up from the start of Avalon Dream past a heathery rake there is a steep narrow face where the next route is found. HONEY BEE 12m HS (4b) Climb the face for about 5m to its right-hand edge and follow the edge past some blocks at the top to finish. Some 50m up and left of the gully from the Avalon Dream buttress there is a broken, overhanging buttress on which there are two climbs. TURNING POINT 20m HVS (5a) Start at a niche on the front right of the buttress. Up right onto a ledge below a roof. Move out precariously onto an exposed edge and then up to become established in a wide crack. Continue up directly, passing to the left of the roof before gaining easier ground. EMBOLDENED 15m VS (4c) Start on the right-hand side of the buttress at a rock pillar. Climb the pillar and with difficulty gain a slabby corner above the overhang. Move up and out right to gain a short groove. Climb past the roof on its right side to finish. A little further to the right along the hillside there is a prominent broken rock ridge with a brown-coloured slab at its base and a projecting rock nose near the top. The following route takes a line up this ridge. PROW BUTTRESS RIDGE 125m VS (4c, 4b, 4c, 4b) Although somewhat disjointed the route offers a series of interesting problems and a perhaps unexpected sense of exposure near the top. Start at the brown slab at the bottom left of the ill-defined ridge. 1. 15m From the centre of the slab move up diagonally left past a series of horizontal breaks to the top left of the slab. 2. 30m Move right over grassy ground to the base of the ridge proper. Climb a slab towards some projecting blocks and pull past these before scrambling to a belay at a rowan tree. 3. 35m Move up a short steep slab behind the tree and then an easy-angled slab to a short chimney corner. Up this with difficulty and continue on for 10-15m to a block belay. 4. 45m Continue up the steepening slab, traversing out below the rock nose to a short overhanging corner with a jammed block. Climb this with an awkward exit and continue up a short wide crack to the right of a large block, finishing directly to the top. Four routes start on the Prow at the top of the previous route. The difficulties are rather short-lived but the rock is clean and there are some exciting moments. SHOOTING STAR 12m HS (4b) Start to the left of the Prow at a steep corner. Climb this and the easier ground above it. FALLEN ANGELS 15m HS (4b) Start to the right of the corner, moving out right below the roof to gain a ledge. Finish up the cleft. THE MILKY WAY 15m VS (5a) Follow the quartz vein to the ledge and up the arête on the left. BLUE HEAVEN * 20m HVS (5b) Start at the quartz vein but move out right in a precarious situation to gain an obvious slanting edge and thence reach the ledge above. Move back left and finish up to the right of the arête. <display_map> </display_map>"

            "description": "Brilliant technical climbing up the hanging groove to the right of Little Oak Crack. Start 2-3m right of Little Oak Crack below the white wall and just left of a cave. Climb up to a hidden peg runner at a large flat hold. Move out right to a flake and a peg runner. Step back left into the groove and finish strenuously up this. Tree belay on the right. The following five climbs are on the south face of the buttress. SQUALL * 15m E1 (5b) Start beneath a hanging groove on the dark south face. From the top of a very large block move leftwards with bold deliberation in an exposed situation onto the arête and strenuously gain the groove above. Follow this more comfortably to the holly tree belay. JET STREAM * 15m E1 (5b) Start as for Squall. Climb the hanging groove and the arête above to the finish. LIGHTNING CRACK ** 15m E2 (5c) Starts 2m right of Squall on the block ledge below a zig-zag finger crack. Follow the strenuous crack slightly leftwards until better holds around a small sloping ledge are reached. Finish up the short cracks leftwards to the arête and the tree belay. ARCHAOS *** 18m E6 (6b) This route boasts the steepest climbing in Wicklow with well protected cranking on perfect granite. Start as for Lightning Crack. Follow Lightning Crack for 2m to a letterbox jug. Move a little to the right before pushing on up to a good rest and a peg-runner shared with Storm Cloud in the horizontal black fault-line undercutting the white rock above. Traverse right for a metre to a good side-pull and then make a tricky move to gain the base of an overhanging groove. Climb this (crux) past a peg runner to an even steeper finish in a wild position. Move down and left to belay at the tree or finish directly up the slab. STORM CLOUD ** 16m E3 (6a) Takes the flake fault-line diagonally leftwards across the wall. Start a few metres right of Lightning Crack and follow the fault-line past a peg-runner to another peg-runner in the horizontal undercut (shared with Archaos). Go past a slight bulge and finish up the wide left-slanting crack just right of the finish of Lightning Cracks. Belay at the holly tree. The next group of climbs are found on the more featureless but less steep east face. The climbing is not as strenuous but is quite thin and delicate in places and requires some careful route-finding. SIDEWINDER ** 35m E1 (5b/c) Essentially a rising traverse climbing the east face from bottom left to top right. Start on a grassy patch on the lowest point of the face.Climb the centre of the wall to a horizontal crack at about 5m. From here take a slightly rising line rightwards (crux) to a long white streak just above a small turf ledge. Continue rightwards to a large hidden stance and follow a right-trending crack before going straight up, passing tree branches with dexterity. DECEPTION ** 30m E2 (5c) An excellent wall climb which starts as for Sidewinder. Follow Sidewinder to the horizontal break and then diagonally right to the base of the obvious long white streak rising from the turf ledge. Follow the streak straight up to an undercut horizontal joint just below the arête. Traverse right for 6m to a large hidden ledge in the centre of the wall. From the middle of the ledge follow a crack to a good flake hold. From here trend left to a good stance on the arête left of a small black overlap. DUPLICITY * 35m E2 (5c, 4a) The crux is short but demanding nonetheless. 1. 20m Start as for Sidewinder which is followed to the horizontal crack. Continue straight up to undercut horizontal joints which intersect the arête. Move out left onto the arête at this point and follow it for about 6 - 7m to a good belay. 2. 15m Continue up to the top in a pleasant situation near the right-hand edge. TOMAHAWK * 35m E1 (5b, 4a) Starts just right of Sidewinder at a short corner. 1. 20m Climb up slightly right to below the peaty ledge and then work out left and up past a bulge on thin holds (crux). Move back right and follow the white streak to just below the small overhang and an obvious lead out left to an arête. Belay a metre or so up the arête. 2. 15m Continue up the right edge of the slab to the top. ====OTHER BUTTRESSES==== A number of other buttresses are scattered along the hillside to the west and east of the Main Buttress. These are described from west to east, starting with the only buttress to the west.

Climb the crack and slab to the break and finish by either the crack leading up to the left or directly up the final slab. HEATHER BEE 15m HS (4b) Follow the quartz edge sloping up right to the edge of the slab. Alternatively start 1 - 2m further right and climb directly to the mid-height ledge. OASIS 17m HS (4b) Takes a direct line up the centre of the slab, starting several metres right of the quartz edge and finishing just right of same. BLUEBELL FAREWELL 22m S (4a) A rising traverse starting just left of the niche and following a crack-line diagonally left across the face. Near the top step up onto the slab above the crack and finish directly. DENIZENS OF OLD 18m VS (4c) Starts at a niche on the right-hand side of the slab. Climb leftwards out of the niche onto the slab and up to the two parallel quartz seams. Follow the left-hand one to a bulge and gain a slanting crack above below the final edge; up this to finish. NEW KID ON THE BLOCK\" 18m HVS(5a) Start as for Denizens of Old up to base of the two parallel quartz seams (moving up Bluebell Farewell makes it possible to place side runners before returning to this point). Tiptoe up by the right-hand seam to reach a horizontal break. Stand comfortably on this before launching up the featureless slab and arete to the top. DANCING WITH EXCITEMENT * 20m HVS (5a) Gain a small foot-ledge right of the niche and move diagonally up left via a slanting edge to the right-hand quartz seam. Work out right along an edge-line to the arête (crux). Finish up the arête. About 50m to the right or east of the Main Buttress and just above a copse there is a large, partly vegetated broken buttress area, the left flank of which has yielded some routes. The next two climbs are found on the bottom left side of this buttress, directly opposite the Main Buttress and just above the copse. SKEDADDLE 14m HS (4b) Start on a ledge below an obvious ramp on the left side of the overhanging outcrop. Climb the ramp and pass blocks carefully to reach an overhanging corner which is surmounted (crux) to finish. DOGPATCH * 21m VS (4a,4c) 1. 13m Start 2m right of Skedaddle on a ledge by a holly bush. Gain the large V-shaped notch, move left and exit onto the large ledge via cracks and flakes. 2. 8m Use large handholds to surmount the roof near its left side. The following route is found on a small rock face just right of the Main Buttress and to the left of the copse. UPWARDLY MOBILE * 10m E1 (5c) Takes a central line on the face and has the character of an extended boulder problem and is harder than it looks. Climb the thin crack in the steep slab directly to the ledge. Move slightly right and surmount the short wall Further up the gully there are some climbs on a holly-clad buttress which are described from right to left. SAFE HAVEN 30m HVS (5a, 4b) Starts about 40m up the gully from Skeddadle below a narrow, left-edged slab. 1. 10m Climb the slab boldly to a furze ledge below the steep holly buttress. 2. 18m Gain a short wall on the left, moving up right to a ledge; up a quartz-rich wall to a stance and surmount a tricky wall above to finish. HEAVEN CAN WAIT * 18m VS (4c) Start below a leftward slanting, bow-shaped crack and climb to a stance. Finish up the slabby wall behind the trees. SHADOWLAND 18m VS (4c) Start below a right-facing corner. Climb up and traverse right at the top to a stance. Move left behind the trees and take a short, wide crack followed by an awkward step to finish. Thread belay well back. LOOK OUT 18m VS (4c) Start below a short wall just left of the corner of Shadowland. Climb the short wall to the right of the thin crack-line, with the help of holds on the arête, to the holly tree. Continue up by a holly tree on the left passing a projecting block to below a slight overhang. Surmount this by moving up left before exiting to the right of the large boulder. The next area of climbing interest is found alongside a large shallow gully about 200m to the right or east of the Main Buttress. There are two routes on a triangular buttress right of the gully. AVALON DREAM ** 20m HVS (4c) An enjoyable route which essentially follows the arête on the left-hand side of the buttress. Start below a short green niche, right of the gully. Gain the groove and follow the left-trending crack above it for some distance before gaining the steep slab on the right. Follow the left edge of the slab to the top. A COLD WINTER'S DAY 25m VS (4c) Start right of the gully below a short wall with a righttrending crack. Climb the crack with an awkward exit right onto a wide ledge (possible belay). Continue up the wall above to a small niche; gain height to a sloping heathery ledge and up on good holds towards the arête on the right which is gained near its highest point for the best finish. About 10m up from the start of Avalon Dream past a heathery rake there is a steep narrow face where the next route is found. HONEY BEE 12m HS (4b) Climb the face for about 5m to its right-hand edge and follow the edge past some blocks at the top to finish. Some 50m up and left of the gully from the Avalon Dream buttress there is a broken, overhanging buttress on which there are two climbs. TURNING POINT 20m HVS (5a) Start at a niche on the front right of the buttress. Up right onto a ledge below a roof. Move out precariously onto an exposed edge and then up to become established in a wide crack. Continue up directly, passing to the left of the roof before gaining easier ground. EMBOLDENED 15m VS (4c) Start on the right-hand side of the buttress at a rock pillar. Climb the pillar and with difficulty gain a slabby corner above the overhang. Move up and out right to gain a short groove. Climb past the roof on its right side to finish. A little further to the right along the hillside there is a prominent broken rock ridge with a brown-coloured slab at its base and a projecting rock nose near the top. The following route takes a line up this ridge. PROW BUTTRESS RIDGE 125m VS (4c, 4b, 4c, 4b) Although somewhat disjointed the route offers a series of interesting problems and a perhaps unexpected sense of exposure near the top. Start at the brown slab at the bottom left of the ill-defined ridge. 1. 15m From the centre of the slab move up diagonally left past a series of horizontal breaks to the top left of the slab. 2. 30m Move right over grassy ground to the base of the ridge proper. Climb a slab towards some projecting blocks and pull past these before scrambling to a belay at a rowan tree. 3. 35m Move up a short steep slab behind the tree and then an easy-angled slab to a short chimney corner. Up this with difficulty and continue on for 10-15m to a block belay. 4. 45m Continue up the steepening slab, traversing out below the rock nose to a short overhanging corner with a jammed block. Climb this with an awkward exit and continue up a short wide crack to the right of a large block, finishing directly to the top. Four routes start on the Prow at the top of the previous route. The difficulties are rather short-lived but the rock is clean and there are some exciting moments. SHOOTING STAR 12m HS (4b) Start to the left of the Prow at a steep corner. Climb this and the easier ground above it. FALLEN ANGELS 15m HS (4b) Start to the right of the corner, moving out right below the roof to gain a ledge. Finish up the cleft. THE MILKY WAY 15m VS (5a) Follow the quartz vein to the ledge and up the arête on the left.

Climb leftwards out of the niche onto the slab and up to the two parallel quartz seams. Follow the left-hand one to a bulge and gain a slanting crack above below the final edge; up this to finish. NEW KID ON THE BLOCK\" 18m HVS(5a) Start as for Denizens of Old up to base of the two parallel quartz seams (moving up Bluebell Farewell makes it possible to place side runners before returning to this point). Tiptoe up by the right-hand seam to reach a horizontal break. Stand comfortably on this before launching up the featureless slab and arete to the top. DANCING WITH EXCITEMENT * 20m HVS (5a) Gain a small foot-ledge right of the niche and move diagonally up left via a slanting edge to the right-hand quartz seam. Work out right along an edge-line to the arête (crux). Finish up the arête. About 50m to the right or east of the Main Buttress and just above a copse there is a large, partly vegetated broken buttress area, the left flank of which has yielded some routes. The next two climbs are found on the bottom left side of this buttress, directly opposite the Main Buttress and just above the copse. SKEDADDLE 14m HS (4b) Start on a ledge below an obvious ramp on the left side of the overhanging outcrop. Climb the ramp and pass blocks carefully to reach an overhanging corner which is surmounted (crux) to finish. DOGPATCH * 21m VS (4a,4c) 1. 13m Start 2m right of Skedaddle on a ledge by a holly bush. Gain the large V-shaped notch, move left and exit onto the large ledge via cracks and flakes. 2. 8m Use large handholds to surmount the roof near its left side. The following route is found on a small rock face just right of the Main Buttress and to the left of the copse. UPWARDLY MOBILE * 10m E1 (5c) Takes a central line on the face and has the character of an extended boulder problem and is harder than it looks. Climb the thin crack in the steep slab directly to the ledge.

LOOK OUT 18m VS (4c) Start below a short wall just left of the corner of Shadowland. Climb the short wall to the right of the thin crack-line, with the help of holds on the arête, to the holly tree. Continue up by a holly tree on the left passing a projecting block to below a slight overhang. Surmount this by moving up left before exiting to the right of the large boulder. The next area of climbing interest is found alongside a large shallow gully about 200m to the right or east of the Main Buttress. There are two routes on a triangular buttress right of the gully. AVALON DREAM ** 20m HVS (4c) An enjoyable route which essentially follows the arête on the left-hand side of the buttress. Start below a short green niche, right of the gully. Gain the groove and follow the left-trending crack above it for some distance before gaining the steep slab on the right. Follow the left edge of the slab to the top. A COLD WINTER'S DAY 25m VS (4c) Start right of the gully below a short wall with a righttrending crack. Climb the crack with an awkward exit right onto a wide ledge (possible belay). Continue up the wall above to a small niche; gain height to a sloping heathery ledge and up on good holds towards the arête on the right which is gained near its highest point for the best finish. About 10m up from the start of Avalon Dream past a heathery rake there is a steep narrow face where the next route is found. HONEY BEE 12m HS (4b) Climb the face for about 5m to its right-hand edge and follow the edge past some blocks at the top to finish. Some 50m up and left of the gully from the Avalon Dream buttress there is a broken, overhanging buttress on which there are two climbs. TURNING POINT 20m HVS (5a) Start at a niche on the front right of the buttress. Up right onto a ledge below a roof. Move out precariously onto an exposed edge and then up to become established in a wide crack. Continue up directly, passing to the left of the roof before gaining easier ground. EMBOLDENED 15m VS (4c) Start on the right-hand side of the buttress at a rock pillar. Climb the pillar and with difficulty gain a slabby corner above the overhang. Move up and out right to gain a short groove. Climb past the roof on its right side to finish. A little further to the right along the hillside there is a prominent broken rock ridge with a brown-coloured slab at its base and a projecting rock nose near the top. The following route takes a line up this ridge. PROW BUTTRESS RIDGE 125m VS (4c, 4b, 4c, 4b) Although somewhat disjointed the route offers a series of interesting problems and a perhaps unexpected sense of exposure near the top. Start at the brown slab at the bottom left of the ill-defined ridge. 1. 15m From the centre of the slab move up diagonally left past a series of horizontal breaks to the top left of the slab. 2. 30m Move right over grassy ground to the base of the ridge proper. Climb a slab towards some projecting blocks and pull past these before scrambling to a belay at a rowan tree. 3. 35m Move up a short steep slab behind the tree and then an easy-angled slab to a short chimney corner. Up this with difficulty and continue on for 10-15m to a block belay. 4. 45m Continue up the steepening slab, traversing out below the rock nose to a short overhanging corner with a jammed block. Climb this with an awkward exit and continue up a short wide crack to the right of a large block, finishing directly to the top. Four routes start on the Prow at the top of the previous route. The difficulties are rather short-lived but the rock is clean and there are some exciting moments. SHOOTING STAR 12m HS (4b) Start to the left of the Prow at a steep corner. Climb this and the easier ground above it. FALLEN ANGELS 15m HS (4b) Start to the right of the corner, moving out right below the roof to gain a ledge. Finish up the cleft. THE MILKY WAY 15m VS (5a) Follow the quartz vein to the ledge and up the arête on the left. BLUE HEAVEN * 20m HVS (5b) Start at the quartz vein but move out right in a precarious situation to gain an obvious slanting edge and thence reach the ledge above. Move back left and finish up to the right of the arête. <display_map> </display_map>"

ARCHAOS *** 18m E6 (6b) This route boasts the steepest climbing in Wicklow with well protected cranking on perfect granite. Start as for Lightning Crack. Follow Lightning Crack for 2m to a letterbox jug. Move a little to the right before pushing on up to a good rest and a peg-runner shared with Storm Cloud in the horizontal black fault-line undercutting the white rock above. Traverse right for a metre to a good side-pull and then make a tricky move to gain the base of an overhanging groove. Climb this (crux) past a peg runner to an even steeper finish in a wild position. Move down and left to belay at the tree or finish directly up the slab. STORM CLOUD ** 16m E3 (6a) Takes the flake fault-line diagonally leftwards across the wall. Start a few metres right of Lightning Crack and follow the fault-line past a peg-runner to another peg-runner in the horizontal undercut (shared with Archaos). Go past a slight bulge and finish up the wide left-slanting crack just right of the finish of Lightning Cracks. Belay at the holly tree. The next group of climbs are found on the more featureless but less steep east face. The climbing is not as strenuous but is quite thin and delicate in places and requires some careful route-finding. SIDEWINDER ** 35m E1 (5b/c) Essentially a rising traverse climbing the east face from bottom left to top right. Start on a grassy patch on the lowest point of the face.Climb the centre of the wall to a horizontal crack at about 5m.

PROW BUTTRESS RIDGE 125m VS (4c, 4b, 4c, 4b) Although somewhat disjointed the route offers a series of interesting problems and a perhaps unexpected sense of exposure near the top. Start at the brown slab at the bottom left of the ill-defined ridge. 1. 15m From the centre of the slab move up diagonally left past a series of horizontal breaks to the top left of the slab. 2. 30m Move right over grassy ground to the base of the ridge proper. Climb a slab towards some projecting blocks and pull past these before scrambling to a belay at a rowan tree. 3. 35m Move up a short steep slab behind the tree and then an easy-angled slab to a short chimney corner. Up this with difficulty and continue on for 10-15m to a block belay. 4. 45m Continue up the steepening slab, traversing out below the rock nose to a short overhanging corner with a jammed block. Climb this with an awkward exit and continue up a short wide crack to the right of a large block, finishing directly to the top. Four routes start on the Prow at the top of the previous route. The difficulties are rather short-lived but the rock is clean and there are some exciting moments. SHOOTING STAR 12m HS (4b) Start to the left of the Prow at a steep corner. Climb this and the easier ground above it. FALLEN ANGELS 15m HS (4b) Start to the right of the corner, moving out right below the roof to gain a ledge. Finish up the cleft. THE MILKY WAY 15m VS (5a) Follow the quartz vein to the ledge and up the arête on the left. BLUE HEAVEN * 20m HVS (5b) Start at the quartz vein but move out right in a precarious situation to gain an obvious slanting edge and thence reach the ledge above. Move back left and finish up to the right of the arête. <display_map> </display_map>"

            "description": "This route boasts the steepest climbing in Wicklow with well protected cranking on perfect granite. Start as for Lightning Crack. Follow Lightning Crack for 2m to a letterbox jug. Move a little to the right before pushing on up to a good rest and a peg-runner shared with Storm Cloud in the horizontal black fault-line undercutting the white rock above. Traverse right for a metre to a good side-pull and then make a tricky move to gain the base of an overhanging groove. Climb this (crux) past a peg runner to an even steeper finish in a wild position. Move down and left to belay at the tree or finish directly up the slab. STORM CLOUD ** 16m E3 (6a) Takes the flake fault-line diagonally leftwards across the wall. Start a few metres right of Lightning Crack and follow the fault-line past a peg-runner to another peg-runner in the horizontal undercut (shared with Archaos). Go past a slight bulge and finish up the wide left-slanting crack just right of the finish of Lightning Cracks. Belay at the holly tree. The next group of climbs are found on the more featureless but less steep east face. The climbing is not as strenuous but is quite thin and delicate in places and requires some careful route-finding. SIDEWINDER ** 35m E1 (5b/c) Essentially a rising traverse climbing the east face from bottom left to top right. Start on a grassy patch on the lowest point of the face.Climb the centre of the wall to a horizontal crack at about 5m. From here take a slightly rising line rightwards (crux) to a long white streak just above a small turf ledge. Continue rightwards to a large hidden stance and follow a right-trending crack before going straight up, passing tree branches with dexterity. DECEPTION ** 30m E2 (5c) An excellent wall climb which starts as for Sidewinder. Follow Sidewinder to the horizontal break and then diagonally right to the base of the obvious long white streak rising from the turf ledge. Follow the streak straight up to an undercut horizontal joint just below the arête. Traverse right for 6m to a large hidden ledge in the centre of the wall. From the middle of the ledge follow a crack to a good flake hold. From here trend left to a good stance on the arête left of a small black overlap. DUPLICITY * 35m E2 (5c, 4a) The crux is short but demanding nonetheless. 1. 20m Start as for Sidewinder which is followed to the horizontal crack. Continue straight up to undercut horizontal joints which intersect the arête. Move out left onto the arête at this point and follow it for about 6 - 7m to a good belay. 2. 15m Continue up to the top in a pleasant situation near the right-hand edge. TOMAHAWK * 35m E1 (5b, 4a) Starts just right of Sidewinder at a short corner. 1. 20m Climb up slightly right to below the peaty ledge and then work out left and up past a bulge on thin holds (crux). Move back right and follow the white streak to just below the small overhang and an obvious lead out left to an arête. Belay a metre or so up the arête. 2. 15m Continue up the right edge of the slab to the top. ====OTHER BUTTRESSES==== A number of other buttresses are scattered along the hillside to the west and east of the Main Buttress. These are described from west to east, starting with the only buttress to the west. This is a steep triangular slab on the edge of the flood-plain, directly behind the ruins of a long-abandoned farmstead and about 500m west of the Main Buttress. The rock is clean and sound. Descent is easy via a ramp to the side of the slab. Ring bolts, useful for belaying, were installed on top of the buttress but have since been hammered flat DRAGONFLY 15m VS (4c) Takes the diagonal crack leading up right to the horizontal break line. Climb the crack and slab to the break and finish by either the crack leading up to the left or directly up the final slab. HEATHER BEE 15m HS (4b) Follow the quartz edge sloping up right to the edge of the slab. Alternatively start 1 - 2m further right and climb directly to the mid-height ledge. OASIS 17m HS (4b) Takes a direct line up the centre of the slab, starting several metres right of the quartz edge and finishing just right of same. BLUEBELL FAREWELL 22m S (4a) A rising traverse starting just left of the niche and following a crack-line diagonally left across the face. Near the top step up onto the slab above the crack and finish directly. DENIZENS OF OLD 18m VS (4c) Starts at a niche on the right-hand side of the slab. Climb leftwards out of the niche onto the slab and up to the two parallel quartz seams. Follow the left-hand one to a bulge and gain a slanting crack above below the final edge; up this to finish. NEW KID ON THE BLOCK\" 18m HVS(5a) Start as for Denizens of Old up to base of the two parallel quartz seams (moving up Bluebell Farewell makes it possible to place side runners before returning to this point). Tiptoe up by the right-hand seam to reach a horizontal break. Stand comfortably on this before launching up the featureless slab and arete to the top. DANCING WITH EXCITEMENT * 20m HVS (5a) Gain a small foot-ledge right of the niche and move diagonally up left via a slanting edge to the right-hand quartz seam. Work out right along an edge-line to the arête (crux). Finish up the arête. About 50m to the right or east of the Main Buttress and just above a copse there is a large, partly vegetated broken buttress area, the left flank of which has yielded some routes. The next two climbs are found on the bottom left side of this buttress, directly opposite the Main Buttress and just above the copse. SKEDADDLE 14m HS (4b) Start on a ledge below an obvious ramp on the left side of the overhanging outcrop. Climb the ramp and pass blocks carefully to reach an overhanging corner which is surmounted (crux) to finish. DOGPATCH * 21m VS (4a,4c) 1. 13m Start 2m right of Skedaddle on a ledge by a holly bush. Gain the large V-shaped notch, move left and exit onto the large ledge via cracks and flakes. 2. 8m Use large handholds to surmount the roof near its left side. The following route is found on a small rock face just right of the Main Buttress and to the left of the copse. UPWARDLY MOBILE * 10m E1 (5c) Takes a central line on the face and has the character of an extended boulder problem and is harder than it looks. Climb the thin crack in the steep slab directly to the ledge. Move slightly right and surmount the short wall Further up the gully there are some climbs on a holly-clad buttress which are described from right to left. SAFE HAVEN 30m HVS (5a, 4b) Starts about 40m up the gully from Skeddadle below a narrow, left-edged slab. 1. 10m Climb the slab boldly to a furze ledge below the steep holly buttress. 2. 18m Gain a short wall on the left, moving up right to a ledge; up a quartz-rich wall to a stance and surmount a tricky wall above to finish. HEAVEN CAN WAIT * 18m VS (4c) Start below a leftward slanting, bow-shaped crack and climb to a stance. Finish up the slabby wall behind the trees. SHADOWLAND 18m VS (4c) Start below a right-facing corner. Climb up and traverse right at the top to a stance. Move left behind the trees and take a short, wide crack followed by an awkward step to finish. Thread belay well back. LOOK OUT 18m VS (4c) Start below a short wall just left of the corner of Shadowland. Climb the short wall to the right of the thin crack-line, with the help of holds on the arête, to the holly tree. Continue up by a holly tree on the left passing a projecting block to below a slight overhang. Surmount this by moving up left before exiting to the right of the large boulder. The next area of climbing interest is found alongside a large shallow gully about 200m to the right or east of the Main Buttress. There are two routes on a triangular buttress right of the gully. AVALON DREAM ** 20m HVS (4c) An enjoyable route which essentially follows the arête on the left-hand side of the buttress. Start below a short green niche, right of the gully. Gain the groove and follow the left-trending crack above it for some distance before gaining the steep slab on the right. Follow the left edge of the slab to the top. A COLD WINTER'S DAY 25m VS (4c) Start right of the gully below a short wall with a righttrending crack. Climb the crack with an awkward exit right onto a wide ledge (possible belay). Continue up the wall above to a small niche; gain height to a sloping heathery ledge and up on good holds towards the arête on the right which is gained near its highest point for the best finish. About 10m up from the start of Avalon Dream past a heathery rake there is a steep narrow face where the next route is found. HONEY BEE 12m HS (4b) Climb the face for about 5m to its right-hand edge and follow the edge past some blocks at the top to finish. Some 50m up and left of the gully from the Avalon Dream buttress there is a broken, overhanging buttress on which there are two climbs. TURNING POINT 20m HVS (5a) Start at a niche on the front right of the buttress. Up right onto a ledge below a roof. Move out precariously onto an exposed edge and then up to become established in a wide crack. Continue up directly, passing to the left of the roof before gaining easier ground. EMBOLDENED 15m VS (4c) Start on the right-hand side of the buttress at a rock pillar. Climb the pillar and with difficulty gain a slabby corner above the overhang. Move up and out right to gain a short groove. Climb past the roof on its right side to finish. A little further to the right along the hillside there is a prominent broken rock ridge with a brown-coloured slab at its base and a projecting rock nose near the top.

UPWARDLY MOBILE * 10m E1 (5c) Takes a central line on the face and has the character of an extended boulder problem and is harder than it looks. Climb the thin crack in the steep slab directly to the ledge. Move slightly right and surmount the short wall Further up the gully there are some climbs on a holly-clad buttress which are described from right to left. SAFE HAVEN 30m HVS (5a, 4b) Starts about 40m up the gully from Skeddadle below a narrow, left-edged slab. 1. 10m Climb the slab boldly to a furze ledge below the steep holly buttress. 2. 18m Gain a short wall on the left, moving up right to a ledge; up a quartz-rich wall to a stance and surmount a tricky wall above to finish. HEAVEN CAN WAIT * 18m VS (4c) Start below a leftward slanting, bow-shaped crack and climb to a stance. Finish up the slabby wall behind the trees. SHADOWLAND 18m VS (4c) Start below a right-facing corner. Climb up and traverse right at the top to a stance. Move left behind the trees and take a short, wide crack followed by an awkward step to finish. Thread belay well back. LOOK OUT 18m VS (4c) Start below a short wall just left of the corner of Shadowland. Climb the short wall to the right of the thin crack-line, with the help of holds on the arête, to the holly tree. Continue up by a holly tree on the left passing a projecting block to below a slight overhang. Surmount this by moving up left before exiting to the right of the large boulder. The next area of climbing interest is found alongside a large shallow gully about 200m to the right or east of the Main Buttress. There are two routes on a triangular buttress right of the gully. AVALON DREAM ** 20m HVS (4c) An enjoyable route which essentially follows the arête on the left-hand side of the buttress. Start below a short green niche, right of the gully. Gain the groove and follow the left-trending crack above it for some distance before gaining the steep slab on the right. Follow the left edge of the slab to the top. A COLD WINTER'S DAY 25m VS (4c) Start right of the gully below a short wall with a righttrending crack. Climb the crack with an awkward exit right onto a wide ledge (possible belay). Continue up the wall above to a small niche; gain height to a sloping heathery ledge and up on good holds towards the arête on the right which is gained near its highest point for the best finish. About 10m up from the start of Avalon Dream past a heathery rake there is a steep narrow face where the next route is found. HONEY BEE 12m HS (4b) Climb the face for about 5m to its right-hand edge and follow the edge past some blocks at the top to finish. Some 50m up and left of the gully from the Avalon Dream buttress there is a broken, overhanging buttress on which there are two climbs. TURNING POINT 20m HVS (5a) Start at a niche on the front right of the buttress. Up right onto a ledge below a roof. Move out precariously onto an exposed edge and then up to become established in a wide crack. Continue up directly, passing to the left of the roof before gaining easier ground. EMBOLDENED 15m VS (4c) Start on the right-hand side of the buttress at a rock pillar. Climb the pillar and with difficulty gain a slabby corner above the overhang. Move up and out right to gain a short groove. Climb past the roof on its right side to finish. A little further to the right along the hillside there is a prominent broken rock ridge with a brown-coloured slab at its base and a projecting rock nose near the top. The following route takes a line up this ridge. PROW BUTTRESS RIDGE 125m VS (4c, 4b, 4c, 4b) Although somewhat disjointed the route offers a series of interesting problems and a perhaps unexpected sense of exposure near the top. Start at the brown slab at the bottom left of the ill-defined ridge. 1. 15m From the centre of the slab move up diagonally left past a series of horizontal breaks to the top left of the slab. 2. 30m Move right over grassy ground to the base of the ridge proper. Climb a slab towards some projecting blocks and pull past these before scrambling to a belay at a rowan tree. 3. 35m Move up a short steep slab behind the tree and then an easy-angled slab to a short chimney corner. Up this with difficulty and continue on for 10-15m to a block belay. 4. 45m Continue up the steepening slab, traversing out below the rock nose to a short overhanging corner with a jammed block. Climb this with an awkward exit and continue up a short wide crack to the right of a large block, finishing directly to the top. Four routes start on the Prow at the top of the previous route. The difficulties are rather short-lived but the rock is clean and there are some exciting moments. SHOOTING STAR 12m HS (4b) Start to the left of the Prow at a steep corner. Climb this and the easier ground above it. FALLEN ANGELS 15m HS (4b) Start to the right of the corner, moving out right below the roof to gain a ledge. Finish up the cleft. THE MILKY WAY 15m VS (5a) Follow the quartz vein to the ledge and up the arête on the left. BLUE HEAVEN * 20m HVS (5b) Start at the quartz vein but move out right in a precarious situation to gain an obvious slanting edge and thence reach the ledge above. Move back left and finish up to the right of the arête. <display_map> </display_map>"

SHADOWLAND 18m VS (4c) Start below a right-facing corner. Climb up and traverse right at the top to a stance. Move left behind the trees and take a short, wide crack followed by an awkward step to finish. Thread belay well back. LOOK OUT 18m VS (4c) Start below a short wall just left of the corner of Shadowland. Climb the short wall to the right of the thin crack-line, with the help of holds on the arête, to the holly tree. Continue up by a holly tree on the left passing a projecting block to below a slight overhang. Surmount this by moving up left before exiting to the right of the large boulder. The next area of climbing interest is found alongside a large shallow gully about 200m to the right or east of the Main Buttress. There are two routes on a triangular buttress right of the gully. AVALON DREAM ** 20m HVS (4c) An enjoyable route which essentially follows the arête on the left-hand side of the buttress. Start below a short green niche, right of the gully. Gain the groove and follow the left-trending crack above it for some distance before gaining the steep slab on the right. Follow the left edge of the slab to the top. A COLD WINTER'S DAY 25m VS (4c) Start right of the gully below a short wall with a righttrending crack. Climb the crack with an awkward exit right onto a wide ledge (possible belay). Continue up the wall above to a small niche; gain height to a sloping heathery ledge and up on good holds towards the arête on the right which is gained near its highest point for the best finish. About 10m up from the start of Avalon Dream past a heathery rake there is a steep narrow face where the next route is found. HONEY BEE 12m HS (4b) Climb the face for about 5m to its right-hand edge and follow the edge past some blocks at the top to finish. Some 50m up and left of the gully from the Avalon Dream buttress there is a broken, overhanging buttress on which there are two climbs. TURNING POINT 20m HVS (5a) Start at a niche on the front right of the buttress. Up right onto a ledge below a roof. Move out precariously onto an exposed edge and then up to become established in a wide crack. Continue up directly, passing to the left of the roof before gaining easier ground. EMBOLDENED 15m VS (4c) Start on the right-hand side of the buttress at a rock pillar. Climb the pillar and with difficulty gain a slabby corner above the overhang. Move up and out right to gain a short groove. Climb past the roof on its right side to finish. A little further to the right along the hillside there is a prominent broken rock ridge with a brown-coloured slab at its base and a projecting rock nose near the top. The following route takes a line up this ridge. PROW BUTTRESS RIDGE 125m VS (4c, 4b, 4c, 4b) Although somewhat disjointed the route offers a series of interesting problems and a perhaps unexpected sense of exposure near the top. Start at the brown slab at the bottom left of the ill-defined ridge. 1. 15m From the centre of the slab move up diagonally left past a series of horizontal breaks to the top left of the slab. 2. 30m Move right over grassy ground to the base of the ridge proper. Climb a slab towards some projecting blocks and pull past these before scrambling to a belay at a rowan tree. 3. 35m Move up a short steep slab behind the tree and then an easy-angled slab to a short chimney corner. Up this with difficulty and continue on for 10-15m to a block belay. 4. 45m Continue up the steepening slab, traversing out below the rock nose to a short overhanging corner with a jammed block. Climb this with an awkward exit and continue up a short wide crack to the right of a large block, finishing directly to the top. Four routes start on the Prow at the top of the previous route. The difficulties are rather short-lived but the rock is clean and there are some exciting moments. SHOOTING STAR 12m HS (4b) Start to the left of the Prow at a steep corner. Climb this and the easier ground above it. FALLEN ANGELS 15m HS (4b) Start to the right of the corner, moving out right below the roof to gain a ledge. Finish up the cleft. THE MILKY WAY 15m VS (5a) Follow the quartz vein to the ledge and up the arête on the left. BLUE HEAVEN * 20m HVS (5b) Start at the quartz vein but move out right in a precarious situation to gain an obvious slanting edge and thence reach the ledge above. Move back left and finish up to the right of the arête. <display_map> </display_map>"

The following route is found on a small rock face just right of the Main Buttress and to the left of the copse. UPWARDLY MOBILE * 10m E1 (5c) Takes a central line on the face and has the character of an extended boulder problem and is harder than it looks. Climb the thin crack in the steep slab directly to the ledge. Move slightly right and surmount the short wall Further up the gully there are some climbs on a holly-clad buttress which are described from right to left. SAFE HAVEN 30m HVS (5a, 4b) Starts about 40m up the gully from Skeddadle below a narrow, left-edged slab. 1. 10m Climb the slab boldly to a furze ledge below the steep holly buttress. 2. 18m Gain a short wall on the left, moving up right to a ledge; up a quartz-rich wall to a stance and surmount a tricky wall above to finish. HEAVEN CAN WAIT * 18m VS (4c) Start below a leftward slanting, bow-shaped crack and climb to a stance. Finish up the slabby wall behind the trees. SHADOWLAND 18m VS (4c) Start below a right-facing corner. Climb up and traverse right at the top to a stance.

LOOK OUT 18m VS (4c) Start below a short wall just left of the corner of Shadowland. Climb the short wall to the right of the thin crack-line, with the help of holds on the arête, to the holly tree. Continue up by a holly tree on the left passing a projecting block to below a slight overhang. Surmount this by moving up left before exiting to the right of the large boulder. The next area of climbing interest is found alongside a large shallow gully about 200m to the right or east of the Main Buttress. There are two routes on a triangular buttress right of the gully. AVALON DREAM ** 20m HVS (4c) An enjoyable route which essentially follows the arête on the left-hand side of the buttress. Start below a short green niche, right of the gully.

A COLD WINTER'S DAY 25m VS (4c) Start right of the gully below a short wall with a righttrending crack. Climb the crack with an awkward exit right onto a wide ledge (possible belay). Continue up the wall above to a small niche; gain height to a sloping heathery ledge and up on good holds towards the arête on the right which is gained near its highest point for the best finish. About 10m up from the start of Avalon Dream past a heathery rake there is a steep narrow face where the next route is found. HONEY BEE 12m HS (4b) Climb the face for about 5m to its right-hand edge and follow the edge past some blocks at the top to finish.

The following route takes a line up this ridge. PROW BUTTRESS RIDGE 125m VS (4c, 4b, 4c, 4b) Although somewhat disjointed the route offers a series of interesting problems and a perhaps unexpected sense of exposure near the top. Start at the brown slab at the bottom left of the ill-defined ridge. 1. 15m From the centre of the slab move up diagonally left past a series of horizontal breaks to the top left of the slab. 2. 30m Move right over grassy ground to the base of the ridge proper. Climb a slab towards some projecting blocks and pull past these before scrambling to a belay at a rowan tree. 3. 35m Move up a short steep slab behind the tree and then an easy-angled slab to a short chimney corner. Up this with difficulty and continue on for 10-15m to a block belay. 4. 45m Continue up the steepening slab, traversing out below the rock nose to a short overhanging corner with a jammed block. Climb this with an awkward exit and continue up a short wide crack to the right of a large block, finishing directly to the top. Four routes start on the Prow at the top of the previous route. The difficulties are rather short-lived but the rock is clean and there are some exciting moments. SHOOTING STAR 12m HS (4b) Start to the left of the Prow at a steep corner.

A COLD WINTER'S DAY 25m VS (4c) Start right of the gully below a short wall with a righttrending crack. Climb the crack with an awkward exit right onto a wide ledge (possible belay). Continue up the wall above to a small niche; gain height to a sloping heathery ledge and up on good holds towards the arête on the right which is gained near its highest point for the best finish. About 10m up from the start of Avalon Dream past a heathery rake there is a steep narrow face where the next route is found. HONEY BEE 12m HS (4b) Climb the face for about 5m to its right-hand edge and follow the edge past some blocks at the top to finish. Some 50m up and left of the gully from the Avalon Dream buttress there is a broken, overhanging buttress on which there are two climbs. TURNING POINT 20m HVS (5a) Start at a niche on the front right of the buttress. Up right onto a ledge below a roof. Move out precariously onto an exposed edge and then up to become established in a wide crack. Continue up directly, passing to the left of the roof before gaining easier ground. EMBOLDENED 15m VS (4c) Start on the right-hand side of the buttress at a rock pillar. Climb the pillar and with difficulty gain a slabby corner above the overhang. Move up and out right to gain a short groove. Climb past the roof on its right side to finish. A little further to the right along the hillside there is a prominent broken rock ridge with a brown-coloured slab at its base and a projecting rock nose near the top. The following route takes a line up this ridge. PROW BUTTRESS RIDGE 125m VS (4c, 4b, 4c, 4b) Although somewhat disjointed the route offers a series of interesting problems and a perhaps unexpected sense of exposure near the top. Start at the brown slab at the bottom left of the ill-defined ridge. 1. 15m From the centre of the slab move up diagonally left past a series of horizontal breaks to the top left of the slab. 2. 30m Move right over grassy ground to the base of the ridge proper. Climb a slab towards some projecting blocks and pull past these before scrambling to a belay at a rowan tree. 3. 35m Move up a short steep slab behind the tree and then an easy-angled slab to a short chimney corner. Up this with difficulty and continue on for 10-15m to a block belay. 4. 45m Continue up the steepening slab, traversing out below the rock nose to a short overhanging corner with a jammed block. Climb this with an awkward exit and continue up a short wide crack to the right of a large block, finishing directly to the top. Four routes start on the Prow at the top of the previous route. The difficulties are rather short-lived but the rock is clean and there are some exciting moments. SHOOTING STAR 12m HS (4b) Start to the left of the Prow at a steep corner. Climb this and the easier ground above it. FALLEN ANGELS 15m HS (4b) Start to the right of the corner, moving out right below the roof to gain a ledge. Finish up the cleft. THE MILKY WAY 15m VS (5a) Follow the quartz vein to the ledge and up the arête on the left. BLUE HEAVEN * 20m HVS (5b) Start at the quartz vein but move out right in a precarious situation to gain an obvious slanting edge and thence reach the ledge above.

            "description": "An enjoyable route which essentially follows the arête on the left-hand side of the buttress. Start below a short green niche, right of the gully. Gain the groove and follow the left-trending crack above it for some distance before gaining the steep slab on the right. Follow the left edge of the slab to the top. A COLD WINTER'S DAY 25m VS (4c) Start right of the gully below a short wall with a righttrending crack. Climb the crack with an awkward exit right onto a wide ledge (possible belay). Continue up the wall above to a small niche; gain height to a sloping heathery ledge and up on good holds towards the arête on the right which is gained near its highest point for the best finish. About 10m up from the start of Avalon Dream past a heathery rake there is a steep narrow face where the next route is found. HONEY BEE 12m HS (4b) Climb the face for about 5m to its right-hand edge and follow the edge past some blocks at the top to finish. Some 50m up and left of the gully from the Avalon Dream buttress there is a broken, overhanging buttress on which there are two climbs. TURNING POINT 20m HVS (5a) Start at a niche on the front right of the buttress. Up right onto a ledge below a roof. Move out precariously onto an exposed edge and then up to become established in a wide crack. Continue up directly, passing to the left of the roof before gaining easier ground. EMBOLDENED 15m VS (4c) Start on the right-hand side of the buttress at a rock pillar. Climb the pillar and with difficulty gain a slabby corner above the overhang. Move up and out right to gain a short groove. Climb past the roof on its right side to finish. A little further to the right along the hillside there is a prominent broken rock ridge with a brown-coloured slab at its base and a projecting rock nose near the top. The following route takes a line up this ridge. PROW BUTTRESS RIDGE 125m VS (4c, 4b, 4c, 4b) Although somewhat disjointed the route offers a series of interesting problems and a perhaps unexpected sense of exposure near the top. Start at the brown slab at the bottom left of the ill-defined ridge. 1. 15m From the centre of the slab move up diagonally left past a series of horizontal breaks to the top left of the slab. 2. 30m Move right over grassy ground to the base of the ridge proper. Climb a slab towards some projecting blocks and pull past these before scrambling to a belay at a rowan tree. 3. 35m Move up a short steep slab behind the tree and then an easy-angled slab to a short chimney corner. Up this with difficulty and continue on for 10-15m to a block belay. 4. 45m Continue up the steepening slab, traversing out below the rock nose to a short overhanging corner with a jammed block. Climb this with an awkward exit and continue up a short wide crack to the right of a large block, finishing directly to the top. Four routes start on the Prow at the top of the previous route. The difficulties are rather short-lived but the rock is clean and there are some exciting moments. SHOOTING STAR 12m HS (4b) Start to the left of the Prow at a steep corner. Climb this and the easier ground above it. FALLEN ANGELS 15m HS (4b) Start to the right of the corner, moving out right below the roof to gain a ledge. Finish up the cleft. THE MILKY WAY 15m VS (5a) Follow the quartz vein to the ledge and up the arête on the left. BLUE HEAVEN * 20m HVS (5b) Start at the quartz vein but move out right in a precarious situation to gain an obvious slanting edge and thence reach the ledge above.
