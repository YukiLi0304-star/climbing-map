            "description": "Climbs listed left to right. ===Mayan Rock=== Mayan Rock Topo: The following two routes are on Mayan Rock, a rock face found in the tree canopy to the left of Pine Tree Ledge: Daoine Eile (HS 4b) 9m Niall S. Murphy, Alan Fogarty Follows the hand sized crack at the left side of the rock face to the top. Belay from trees. Daoine Maithe (HVS 5a) 13m Niall S. Murphy, Rafal Barszczak Start at the same crack as Daoine, but traverse out right under the small bulge to the small cracks with good gear, continue straight up. Belay from trees. ===Maol Wall=== Short steep section of the crag which has three faces, one on the left, the main castle facing side and another face around the right side. Grainne (HVS? 4c) 9m Niall S. Murphy, Alan Fogarty A steep short and sweet route. Starts on the right side of the castle facing side of Maol Wall, just to the right of the large detached block, follow the small finger crack then tend rightward. Protection at the top of the route is small or lacking, caution is advised. Cooley Crack (VS 4b) 10m Niall S. Murphy The large obvious crack on the back of the righthand side of Maol Wall, beware the loose block below the rhododendron stumps. ===Pine Tree Ledge=== The easiest way to get to Pine Tree Ledge is from the 2nd tunnel described above in the \"approach\", once you reach the northside face just walk left along the rough track. Alternatively it can be reached by abseiling down \"Navicula\" or \"Fire Cert\" or scrambling down \"Scram Bull\" if you are confident enough in doing so. Pine Tree Ledge Topo: Zambezi Nights (S 4a)12m Niall S. Murphy Start just to the right of \"Cooley Crack\", the climb goes up the corner/gully, good gear. Squawk Code (HS 4b)12m Niall S. Murphy Scramble up onto the ledge to the left of the start of snotser, climb the short slab to gain the ledge below the steep wall, the climb goes up the obvious finger crack. Snotser (HS 4b)18m Niall S. Murphy, Rafal Barszczak Scramble up the easily angled rock to a ledge. From the ledge climb the corner with the off width crack which leads to a short left tending ramp, climb the crack behind the ramp to the top. Or more easily follow the ramp. Fire Certificate (S 4a) 18m This climb is found in the center of the \"Pine Tree Ledge\" area. Start at a V groove in the rock and bridge up for 4m without protection on good holds. Clamber up the groove or the arête to top out on pine tree ledge, belay from the tree with backup. Fire Certificate \"Alternate Start\" (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy, An alternative start that is a bit shorter but has some protection available in the wide crack that makes up the start. Two meters to the right of the \"V-groove corner\" start of \"Fire Certificate\" scramble up the small earth bank. Climb the crack, tend left at the top of the crack to join fire cert. Navicula (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy Starts just to the right of Fire Cert Alt Start, climb the cracks on the right, which brings you out onto the open face, climb the face up to the pine tree. Dat Dere (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy, Start just left of the \"roof\" which is close to the ground, climb behind the tree and follow the righthand tending crack, belay from top out or continue up and left to the pine tree. Scram Bull (D 3a)15m Niall S. Murphy, Easy line that can be used to get up or down pine tree ledge. ===Middle Yurt=== A section of the crag with easier angled slabs and ledges between \"pine tree ledge\" and \"the northside\". Midshift Madness (S 4a) 23m Niall S. Murphy, Alan Fogarty Starts three meters to the left of \"The Gabhar\", once the first ledge is reached trend left until the steeper slab is reached. Climb left side of the slab to a ledge, move up the groove to the right of the arete. The Gabhar (S 4a) 22m Starts on the right side of \"middle yurt\" just to the right of the rhododendron tree growing at the base, climb the obvious gully to the first ledge, then continue up the gully towards the crux where the face steepens before another ledge, from the ledge tend right to the short corner, climb this to top out. ===Northside=== Northside Topo (left end): Three Piece Sweet (S 4a) 30m, 2 pitches PR: M Go to the left of De Northside face past “Sharran’s Craic” for 15m till you come to an 8m high detached pinnacle which has a pointed 1m high rock coming out from the ground at the base of it. 1. (4a) At the left end of the pinnacle is a cave and a tree beside it. Climb up onto the arête and continue to top of pinnacle. Step left onto a ramp which trends up leftwards until you come to a point where you can step up right to climb straight up on the slab to an angled grassy area (thread belay). 2. (3c) Move right to cross underneath the roof above and then climb up the crack on the right of it to the top. Variation The Sofa Start (HS 4b) PR: P Start at the right side of the base of the pinnacle and step onto the detached rock. From here step onto the pinnacle and up delicately trending left to the left arête and to the top of the pinnacle. PR: P No protection for this section hence HS 4b rating. Captain Planet (VS 4c) 25m Climb the slightly overhanging crack in the pinnacle. Join Three Piece Sweet and follow it until the overhang below the headwall. Arrange gear and climb up the corner. Move diagonally right up the head wall with interest to the top. . Sharran’s Craic (VS 4c) 24m Walk 4m to the left of The Snapper and you will see a vertical crack in the face, this is the start of the climb. The bouldery start is the crux of the climb and you must move up on small flakes and edges above the protection to reach easier holds. Climb the crack above until it finishes and then move left 2 meters into a V shaped short gully and climb this. From the top of the gully trend right over easier ledges following the cleaned rock to a crack, climb the crack and follow the obvious route to the easy finish. Nicky Place (Diff) 6m to the left of the snapper you come to an alcove, climb this on the left side then right at 6m up the crack to the right of “Sharran’s Craic”. Finish as for “Sharran’s Craic”. Sail of the Sentry (VS 4b)** 16m Access the start by scrambling up the first 3m of The Snapper and moving a few metres left, along the grassy ledge, to the shallow ‘sentry box’ in the corner. The climb starts here. Move to the top of the sentry box, reach out and climb right and up onto a narrow ledge. Using the groove on the left, move up easily on good holds to the larger ledge above. Move over right to just left of a diagonal crack (possible long runner) and climb boldly leftwards & up with a delicate move (crux) to finish (escape possible to the left before tackling the crux). The Snapper (VS 4c)*** 25m Immediately in front of the entrance tunnel to De Northside face you will see a large (3m high) triangular block detached from the face, this is the start of the climb. Climb up the block on easy holds and stand on the top, place protection in the flake above and step up, follow the flake left until it peters out. Clamber on to the top (crux) of the flake (subtle move) and reach into the scoop for an excellent hand hold, place protection on your left and move up the slab on crimps and small pockets trending rightwards. Aim for vertical righthand crack above and move up this to finish up over blocky slab to belay point. Sin Binn (E1 5b)** 23m The climb starts 3m to the right of the detached block of the snapper. Start by following the fine vertical crack up to the small ledges, just above head height. Move left by using sidepulls and a high step to the ledge on the small outside corner (crux). Using small holds above continue up the vertical face until better holds appear before gaining the grassy ledge, scramble up over easier ground to the top. Georgie Burgess (VS 4c)* 21m Follow the obvious groove to the bulge. The bulge provides the crux of the route and can be protected by small wires. Tricky moves lead to a high jug which helps you mount the bulge onto the small slab above. Continue up the slab to blockier ground. Me Tarzan, You Insane! (S 4a) 20m PR: M/G A couple of metres to the right of De Northside face entrance is a distinct inset alcove just above head height. Climb straight up the inverted triangular face just to the right of this and make a a delicate push up to gain easier ground. Climb the obvious crack in the short face on your left (great view over the top), scramble across easy ground to the face on the left side and climb the diagonal crack with a delicate move to finish (crux). PR: M/G – Protection is good but for delicate step up near the start of the climb gear is below your feet (or over 1m away on a long runner tucked around the corner in the alcove higher up on the left if you wish). The Budgie Has Landed (S 4a) 22m PR: G Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. Climb goes up left side of the obvious slab, then briefly across vegetated gully and up the obvious alcove on the left at the top. Climb up triangular block (no gear but straightforward) and initially move up right (for a cam placement if you don’t want a long ‘run in’). Strike leftward to follow clear thin diagonal crack running up the left side. Follow this as far as protection/bravery takes you and then cross grassy gully to alcove on the left with a protruding block overhead. Climb up alcove on the right to finish. (Challenge is to stay on the rock and off the grassy gully on your left). The Budgie {Bites Back} (VS 4c) 20 mtrs PR: G° New finish in { } Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top. The Commitment {Direct}** (HS 4b) 20 mtrs PR: G New finish in { } Start on the 2 mtr high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

Murphy, Rafal Barszczak Start at the same crack as Daoine, but traverse out right under the small bulge to the small cracks with good gear, continue straight up. Belay from trees. ===Maol Wall=== Short steep section of the crag which has three faces, one on the left, the main castle facing side and another face around the right side. Grainne (HVS? 4c) 9m Niall S. Murphy, Alan Fogarty A steep short and sweet route. Starts on the right side of the castle facing side of Maol Wall, just to the right of the large detached block, follow the small finger crack then tend rightward. Protection at the top of the route is small or lacking, caution is advised. Cooley Crack (VS 4b) 10m Niall S. Murphy The large obvious crack on the back of the righthand side of Maol Wall, beware the loose block below the rhododendron stumps. ===Pine Tree Ledge=== The easiest way to get to Pine Tree Ledge is from the 2nd tunnel described above in the \"approach\", once you reach the northside face just walk left along the rough track. Alternatively it can be reached by abseiling down \"Navicula\" or \"Fire Cert\" or scrambling down \"Scram Bull\" if you are confident enough in doing so. Pine Tree Ledge Topo: Zambezi Nights (S 4a)12m Niall S. Murphy Start just to the right of \"Cooley Crack\", the climb goes up the corner/gully, good gear. Squawk Code (HS 4b)12m Niall S. Murphy Scramble up onto the ledge to the left of the start of snotser, climb the short slab to gain the ledge below the steep wall, the climb goes up the obvious finger crack. Snotser (HS 4b)18m Niall S. Murphy, Rafal Barszczak Scramble up the easily angled rock to a ledge. From the ledge climb the corner with the off width crack which leads to a short left tending ramp, climb the crack behind the ramp to the top. Or more easily follow the ramp. Fire Certificate (S 4a) 18m This climb is found in the center of the \"Pine Tree Ledge\" area. Start at a V groove in the rock and bridge up for 4m without protection on good holds. Clamber up the groove or the arête to top out on pine tree ledge, belay from the tree with backup. Fire Certificate \"Alternate Start\" (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy, An alternative start that is a bit shorter but has some protection available in the wide crack that makes up the start. Two meters to the right of the \"V-groove corner\" start of \"Fire Certificate\" scramble up the small earth bank. Climb the crack, tend left at the top of the crack to join fire cert. Navicula (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy Starts just to the right of Fire Cert Alt Start, climb the cracks on the right, which brings you out onto the open face, climb the face up to the pine tree. Dat Dere (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy, Start just left of the \"roof\" which is close to the ground, climb behind the tree and follow the righthand tending crack, belay from top out or continue up and left to the pine tree. Scram Bull (D 3a)15m Niall S. Murphy, Easy line that can be used to get up or down pine tree ledge. ===Middle Yurt=== A section of the crag with easier angled slabs and ledges between \"pine tree ledge\" and \"the northside\". Midshift Madness (S 4a) 23m Niall S. Murphy, Alan Fogarty Starts three meters to the left of \"The Gabhar\", once the first ledge is reached trend left until the steeper slab is reached. Climb left side of the slab to a ledge, move up the groove to the right of the arete. The Gabhar (S 4a) 22m Starts on the right side of \"middle yurt\" just to the right of the rhododendron tree growing at the base, climb the obvious gully to the first ledge, then continue up the gully towards the crux where the face steepens before another ledge, from the ledge tend right to the short corner, climb this to top out. ===Northside=== Northside Topo (left end): Three Piece Sweet (S 4a) 30m, 2 pitches PR: M Go to the left of De Northside face past “Sharran’s Craic” for 15m till you come to an 8m high detached pinnacle which has a pointed 1m high rock coming out from the ground at the base of it. 1. (4a) At the left end of the pinnacle is a cave and a tree beside it. Climb up onto the arête and continue to top of pinnacle. Step left onto a ramp which trends up leftwards until you come to a point where you can step up right to climb straight up on the slab to an angled grassy area (thread belay). 2. (3c) Move right to cross underneath the roof above and then climb up the crack on the right of it to the top. Variation The Sofa Start (HS 4b) PR: P Start at the right side of the base of the pinnacle and step onto the detached rock. From here step onto the pinnacle and up delicately trending left to the left arête and to the top of the pinnacle. PR: P No protection for this section hence HS 4b rating. Captain Planet (VS 4c) 25m Climb the slightly overhanging crack in the pinnacle. Join Three Piece Sweet and follow it until the overhang below the headwall. Arrange gear and climb up the corner. Move diagonally right up the head wall with interest to the top. . Sharran’s Craic (VS 4c) 24m Walk 4m to the left of The Snapper and you will see a vertical crack in the face, this is the start of the climb. The bouldery start is the crux of the climb and you must move up on small flakes and edges above the protection to reach easier holds. Climb the crack above until it finishes and then move left 2 meters into a V shaped short gully and climb this. From the top of the gully trend right over easier ledges following the cleaned rock to a crack, climb the crack and follow the obvious route to the easy finish. Nicky Place (Diff) 6m to the left of the snapper you come to an alcove, climb this on the left side then right at 6m up the crack to the right of “Sharran’s Craic”. Finish as for “Sharran’s Craic”. Sail of the Sentry (VS 4b)** 16m Access the start by scrambling up the first 3m of The Snapper and moving a few metres left, along the grassy ledge, to the shallow ‘sentry box’ in the corner. The climb starts here. Move to the top of the sentry box, reach out and climb right and up onto a narrow ledge. Using the groove on the left, move up easily on good holds to the larger ledge above. Move over right to just left of a diagonal crack (possible long runner) and climb boldly leftwards & up with a delicate move (crux) to finish (escape possible to the left before tackling the crux). The Snapper (VS 4c)*** 25m Immediately in front of the entrance tunnel to De Northside face you will see a large (3m high) triangular block detached from the face, this is the start of the climb. Climb up the block on easy holds and stand on the top, place protection in the flake above and step up, follow the flake left until it peters out. Clamber on to the top (crux) of the flake (subtle move) and reach into the scoop for an excellent hand hold, place protection on your left and move up the slab on crimps and small pockets trending rightwards. Aim for vertical righthand crack above and move up this to finish up over blocky slab to belay point. Sin Binn (E1 5b)** 23m The climb starts 3m to the right of the detached block of the snapper. Start by following the fine vertical crack up to the small ledges, just above head height. Move left by using sidepulls and a high step to the ledge on the small outside corner (crux). Using small holds above continue up the vertical face until better holds appear before gaining the grassy ledge, scramble up over easier ground to the top. Georgie Burgess (VS 4c)* 21m Follow the obvious groove to the bulge. The bulge provides the crux of the route and can be protected by small wires. Tricky moves lead to a high jug which helps you mount the bulge onto the small slab above. Continue up the slab to blockier ground. Me Tarzan, You Insane! (S 4a) 20m PR: M/G A couple of metres to the right of De Northside face entrance is a distinct inset alcove just above head height. Climb straight up the inverted triangular face just to the right of this and make a a delicate push up to gain easier ground. Climb the obvious crack in the short face on your left (great view over the top), scramble across easy ground to the face on the left side and climb the diagonal crack with a delicate move to finish (crux). PR: M/G – Protection is good but for delicate step up near the start of the climb gear is below your feet (or over 1m away on a long runner tucked around the corner in the alcove higher up on the left if you wish). The Budgie Has Landed (S 4a) 22m PR: G Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. Climb goes up left side of the obvious slab, then briefly across vegetated gully and up the obvious alcove on the left at the top. Climb up triangular block (no gear but straightforward) and initially move up right (for a cam placement if you don’t want a long ‘run in’). Strike leftward to follow clear thin diagonal crack running up the left side. Follow this as far as protection/bravery takes you and then cross grassy gully to alcove on the left with a protruding block overhead. Climb up alcove on the right to finish. (Challenge is to stay on the rock and off the grassy gully on your left). The Budgie {Bites Back} (VS 4c) 20 mtrs PR: G° New finish in { } Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top. The Commitment {Direct}** (HS 4b) 20 mtrs PR: G New finish in { } Start on the 2 mtr high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

Belay from trees. ===Maol Wall=== Short steep section of the crag which has three faces, one on the left, the main castle facing side and another face around the right side. Grainne (HVS? 4c) 9m Niall S. Murphy, Alan Fogarty A steep short and sweet route. Starts on the right side of the castle facing side of Maol Wall, just to the right of the large detached block, follow the small finger crack then tend rightward. Protection at the top of the route is small or lacking, caution is advised. Cooley Crack (VS 4b) 10m Niall S. Murphy The large obvious crack on the back of the righthand side of Maol Wall, beware the loose block below the rhododendron stumps. ===Pine Tree Ledge=== The easiest way to get to Pine Tree Ledge is from the 2nd tunnel described above in the \"approach\", once you reach the northside face just walk left along the rough track. Alternatively it can be reached by abseiling down \"Navicula\" or \"Fire Cert\" or scrambling down \"Scram Bull\" if you are confident enough in doing so. Pine Tree Ledge Topo: Zambezi Nights (S 4a)12m Niall S. Murphy Start just to the right of \"Cooley Crack\", the climb goes up the corner/gully, good gear. Squawk Code (HS 4b)12m Niall S. Murphy Scramble up onto the ledge to the left of the start of snotser, climb the short slab to gain the ledge below the steep wall, the climb goes up the obvious finger crack. Snotser (HS 4b)18m Niall S. Murphy, Rafal Barszczak Scramble up the easily angled rock to a ledge. From the ledge climb the corner with the off width crack which leads to a short left tending ramp, climb the crack behind the ramp to the top. Or more easily follow the ramp. Fire Certificate (S 4a) 18m This climb is found in the center of the \"Pine Tree Ledge\" area. Start at a V groove in the rock and bridge up for 4m without protection on good holds. Clamber up the groove or the arête to top out on pine tree ledge, belay from the tree with backup. Fire Certificate \"Alternate Start\" (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy, An alternative start that is a bit shorter but has some protection available in the wide crack that makes up the start. Two meters to the right of the \"V-groove corner\" start of \"Fire Certificate\" scramble up the small earth bank. Climb the crack, tend left at the top of the crack to join fire cert. Navicula (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy Starts just to the right of Fire Cert Alt Start, climb the cracks on the right, which brings you out onto the open face, climb the face up to the pine tree. Dat Dere (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy, Start just left of the \"roof\" which is close to the ground, climb behind the tree and follow the righthand tending crack, belay from top out or continue up and left to the pine tree. Scram Bull (D 3a)15m Niall S. Murphy, Easy line that can be used to get up or down pine tree ledge. ===Middle Yurt=== A section of the crag with easier angled slabs and ledges between \"pine tree ledge\" and \"the northside\". Midshift Madness (S 4a) 23m Niall S. Murphy, Alan Fogarty Starts three meters to the left of \"The Gabhar\", once the first ledge is reached trend left until the steeper slab is reached. Climb left side of the slab to a ledge, move up the groove to the right of the arete. The Gabhar (S 4a) 22m Starts on the right side of \"middle yurt\" just to the right of the rhododendron tree growing at the base, climb the obvious gully to the first ledge, then continue up the gully towards the crux where the face steepens before another ledge, from the ledge tend right to the short corner, climb this to top out. ===Northside=== Northside Topo (left end): Three Piece Sweet (S 4a) 30m, 2 pitches PR: M Go to the left of De Northside face past “Sharran’s Craic” for 15m till you come to an 8m high detached pinnacle which has a pointed 1m high rock coming out from the ground at the base of it. 1. (4a) At the left end of the pinnacle is a cave and a tree beside it. Climb up onto the arête and continue to top of pinnacle. Step left onto a ramp which trends up leftwards until you come to a point where you can step up right to climb straight up on the slab to an angled grassy area (thread belay). 2. (3c) Move right to cross underneath the roof above and then climb up the crack on the right of it to the top. Variation The Sofa Start (HS 4b) PR: P Start at the right side of the base of the pinnacle and step onto the detached rock. From here step onto the pinnacle and up delicately trending left to the left arête and to the top of the pinnacle. PR: P No protection for this section hence HS 4b rating. Captain Planet (VS 4c) 25m Climb the slightly overhanging crack in the pinnacle. Join Three Piece Sweet and follow it until the overhang below the headwall. Arrange gear and climb up the corner. Move diagonally right up the head wall with interest to the top. . Sharran’s Craic (VS 4c) 24m Walk 4m to the left of The Snapper and you will see a vertical crack in the face, this is the start of the climb. The bouldery start is the crux of the climb and you must move up on small flakes and edges above the protection to reach easier holds. Climb the crack above until it finishes and then move left 2 meters into a V shaped short gully and climb this. From the top of the gully trend right over easier ledges following the cleaned rock to a crack, climb the crack and follow the obvious route to the easy finish. Nicky Place (Diff) 6m to the left of the snapper you come to an alcove, climb this on the left side then right at 6m up the crack to the right of “Sharran’s Craic”. Finish as for “Sharran’s Craic”. Sail of the Sentry (VS 4b)** 16m Access the start by scrambling up the first 3m of The Snapper and moving a few metres left, along the grassy ledge, to the shallow ‘sentry box’ in the corner. The climb starts here. Move to the top of the sentry box, reach out and climb right and up onto a narrow ledge. Using the groove on the left, move up easily on good holds to the larger ledge above. Move over right to just left of a diagonal crack (possible long runner) and climb boldly leftwards & up with a delicate move (crux) to finish (escape possible to the left before tackling the crux). The Snapper (VS 4c)*** 25m Immediately in front of the entrance tunnel to De Northside face you will see a large (3m high) triangular block detached from the face, this is the start of the climb. Climb up the block on easy holds and stand on the top, place protection in the flake above and step up, follow the flake left until it peters out. Clamber on to the top (crux) of the flake (subtle move) and reach into the scoop for an excellent hand hold, place protection on your left and move up the slab on crimps and small pockets trending rightwards. Aim for vertical righthand crack above and move up this to finish up over blocky slab to belay point. Sin Binn (E1 5b)** 23m The climb starts 3m to the right of the detached block of the snapper. Start by following the fine vertical crack up to the small ledges, just above head height. Move left by using sidepulls and a high step to the ledge on the small outside corner (crux). Using small holds above continue up the vertical face until better holds appear before gaining the grassy ledge, scramble up over easier ground to the top. Georgie Burgess (VS 4c)* 21m Follow the obvious groove to the bulge. The bulge provides the crux of the route and can be protected by small wires. Tricky moves lead to a high jug which helps you mount the bulge onto the small slab above. Continue up the slab to blockier ground. Me Tarzan, You Insane! (S 4a) 20m PR: M/G A couple of metres to the right of De Northside face entrance is a distinct inset alcove just above head height. Climb straight up the inverted triangular face just to the right of this and make a a delicate push up to gain easier ground. Climb the obvious crack in the short face on your left (great view over the top), scramble across easy ground to the face on the left side and climb the diagonal crack with a delicate move to finish (crux). PR: M/G – Protection is good but for delicate step up near the start of the climb gear is below your feet (or over 1m away on a long runner tucked around the corner in the alcove higher up on the left if you wish). The Budgie Has Landed (S 4a) 22m PR: G Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. Climb goes up left side of the obvious slab, then briefly across vegetated gully and up the obvious alcove on the left at the top. Climb up triangular block (no gear but straightforward) and initially move up right (for a cam placement if you don’t want a long ‘run in’). Strike leftward to follow clear thin diagonal crack running up the left side. Follow this as far as protection/bravery takes you and then cross grassy gully to alcove on the left with a protruding block overhead. Climb up alcove on the right to finish. (Challenge is to stay on the rock and off the grassy gully on your left). The Budgie {Bites Back} (VS 4c) 20 mtrs PR: G° New finish in { } Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top. The Commitment {Direct}** (HS 4b) 20 mtrs PR: G New finish in { } Start on the 2 mtr high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

Starts on the right side of the castle facing side of Maol Wall, just to the right of the large detached block, follow the small finger crack then tend rightward. Protection at the top of the route is small or lacking, caution is advised. Cooley Crack (VS 4b) 10m Niall S. Murphy The large obvious crack on the back of the righthand side of Maol Wall, beware the loose block below the rhododendron stumps. ===Pine Tree Ledge=== The easiest way to get to Pine Tree Ledge is from the 2nd tunnel described above in the \"approach\", once you reach the northside face just walk left along the rough track. Alternatively it can be reached by abseiling down \"Navicula\" or \"Fire Cert\" or scrambling down \"Scram Bull\" if you are confident enough in doing so. Pine Tree Ledge Topo: Zambezi Nights (S 4a)12m Niall S. Murphy Start just to the right of \"Cooley Crack\", the climb goes up the corner/gully, good gear. Squawk Code (HS 4b)12m Niall S. Murphy Scramble up onto the ledge to the left of the start of snotser, climb the short slab to gain the ledge below the steep wall, the climb goes up the obvious finger crack. Snotser (HS 4b)18m Niall S. Murphy, Rafal Barszczak Scramble up the easily angled rock to a ledge. From the ledge climb the corner with the off width crack which leads to a short left tending ramp, climb the crack behind the ramp to the top. Or more easily follow the ramp. Fire Certificate (S 4a) 18m This climb is found in the center of the \"Pine Tree Ledge\" area. Start at a V groove in the rock and bridge up for 4m without protection on good holds. Clamber up the groove or the arête to top out on pine tree ledge, belay from the tree with backup. Fire Certificate \"Alternate Start\" (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy, An alternative start that is a bit shorter but has some protection available in the wide crack that makes up the start. Two meters to the right of the \"V-groove corner\" start of \"Fire Certificate\" scramble up the small earth bank. Climb the crack, tend left at the top of the crack to join fire cert. Navicula (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy Starts just to the right of Fire Cert Alt Start, climb the cracks on the right, which brings you out onto the open face, climb the face up to the pine tree. Dat Dere (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy, Start just left of the \"roof\" which is close to the ground, climb behind the tree and follow the righthand tending crack, belay from top out or continue up and left to the pine tree. Scram Bull (D 3a)15m Niall S. Murphy, Easy line that can be used to get up or down pine tree ledge. ===Middle Yurt=== A section of the crag with easier angled slabs and ledges between \"pine tree ledge\" and \"the northside\". Midshift Madness (S 4a) 23m Niall S. Murphy, Alan Fogarty Starts three meters to the left of \"The Gabhar\", once the first ledge is reached trend left until the steeper slab is reached. Climb left side of the slab to a ledge, move up the groove to the right of the arete. The Gabhar (S 4a) 22m Starts on the right side of \"middle yurt\" just to the right of the rhododendron tree growing at the base, climb the obvious gully to the first ledge, then continue up the gully towards the crux where the face steepens before another ledge, from the ledge tend right to the short corner, climb this to top out. ===Northside=== Northside Topo (left end): Three Piece Sweet (S 4a) 30m, 2 pitches PR: M Go to the left of De Northside face past “Sharran’s Craic” for 15m till you come to an 8m high detached pinnacle which has a pointed 1m high rock coming out from the ground at the base of it. 1. (4a) At the left end of the pinnacle is a cave and a tree beside it. Climb up onto the arête and continue to top of pinnacle. Step left onto a ramp which trends up leftwards until you come to a point where you can step up right to climb straight up on the slab to an angled grassy area (thread belay). 2. (3c) Move right to cross underneath the roof above and then climb up the crack on the right of it to the top. Variation The Sofa Start (HS 4b) PR: P Start at the right side of the base of the pinnacle and step onto the detached rock. From here step onto the pinnacle and up delicately trending left to the left arête and to the top of the pinnacle. PR: P No protection for this section hence HS 4b rating. Captain Planet (VS 4c) 25m Climb the slightly overhanging crack in the pinnacle. Join Three Piece Sweet and follow it until the overhang below the headwall. Arrange gear and climb up the corner. Move diagonally right up the head wall with interest to the top. . Sharran’s Craic (VS 4c) 24m Walk 4m to the left of The Snapper and you will see a vertical crack in the face, this is the start of the climb. The bouldery start is the crux of the climb and you must move up on small flakes and edges above the protection to reach easier holds. Climb the crack above until it finishes and then move left 2 meters into a V shaped short gully and climb this. From the top of the gully trend right over easier ledges following the cleaned rock to a crack, climb the crack and follow the obvious route to the easy finish. Nicky Place (Diff) 6m to the left of the snapper you come to an alcove, climb this on the left side then right at 6m up the crack to the right of “Sharran’s Craic”. Finish as for “Sharran’s Craic”. Sail of the Sentry (VS 4b)** 16m Access the start by scrambling up the first 3m of The Snapper and moving a few metres left, along the grassy ledge, to the shallow ‘sentry box’ in the corner. The climb starts here. Move to the top of the sentry box, reach out and climb right and up onto a narrow ledge. Using the groove on the left, move up easily on good holds to the larger ledge above. Move over right to just left of a diagonal crack (possible long runner) and climb boldly leftwards & up with a delicate move (crux) to finish (escape possible to the left before tackling the crux). The Snapper (VS 4c)*** 25m Immediately in front of the entrance tunnel to De Northside face you will see a large (3m high) triangular block detached from the face, this is the start of the climb. Climb up the block on easy holds and stand on the top, place protection in the flake above and step up, follow the flake left until it peters out. Clamber on to the top (crux) of the flake (subtle move) and reach into the scoop for an excellent hand hold, place protection on your left and move up the slab on crimps and small pockets trending rightwards. Aim for vertical righthand crack above and move up this to finish up over blocky slab to belay point. Sin Binn (E1 5b)** 23m The climb starts 3m to the right of the detached block of the snapper. Start by following the fine vertical crack up to the small ledges, just above head height. Move left by using sidepulls and a high step to the ledge on the small outside corner (crux). Using small holds above continue up the vertical face until better holds appear before gaining the grassy ledge, scramble up over easier ground to the top. Georgie Burgess (VS 4c)* 21m Follow the obvious groove to the bulge. The bulge provides the crux of the route and can be protected by small wires. Tricky moves lead to a high jug which helps you mount the bulge onto the small slab above. Continue up the slab to blockier ground. Me Tarzan, You Insane! (S 4a) 20m PR: M/G A couple of metres to the right of De Northside face entrance is a distinct inset alcove just above head height. Climb straight up the inverted triangular face just to the right of this and make a a delicate push up to gain easier ground. Climb the obvious crack in the short face on your left (great view over the top), scramble across easy ground to the face on the left side and climb the diagonal crack with a delicate move to finish (crux). PR: M/G – Protection is good but for delicate step up near the start of the climb gear is below your feet (or over 1m away on a long runner tucked around the corner in the alcove higher up on the left if you wish). The Budgie Has Landed (S 4a) 22m PR: G Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. Climb goes up left side of the obvious slab, then briefly across vegetated gully and up the obvious alcove on the left at the top. Climb up triangular block (no gear but straightforward) and initially move up right (for a cam placement if you don’t want a long ‘run in’). Strike leftward to follow clear thin diagonal crack running up the left side. Follow this as far as protection/bravery takes you and then cross grassy gully to alcove on the left with a protruding block overhead. Climb up alcove on the right to finish. (Challenge is to stay on the rock and off the grassy gully on your left). The Budgie {Bites Back} (VS 4c) 20 mtrs PR: G° New finish in { } Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top. The Commitment {Direct}** (HS 4b) 20 mtrs PR: G New finish in { } Start on the 2 mtr high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

Murphy The large obvious crack on the back of the righthand side of Maol Wall, beware the loose block below the rhododendron stumps. ===Pine Tree Ledge=== The easiest way to get to Pine Tree Ledge is from the 2nd tunnel described above in the \"approach\", once you reach the northside face just walk left along the rough track. Alternatively it can be reached by abseiling down \"Navicula\" or \"Fire Cert\" or scrambling down \"Scram Bull\" if you are confident enough in doing so. Pine Tree Ledge Topo: Zambezi Nights (S 4a)12m Niall S. Murphy Start just to the right of \"Cooley Crack\", the climb goes up the corner/gully, good gear. Squawk Code (HS 4b)12m Niall S. Murphy Scramble up onto the ledge to the left of the start of snotser, climb the short slab to gain the ledge below the steep wall, the climb goes up the obvious finger crack. Snotser (HS 4b)18m Niall S. Murphy, Rafal Barszczak Scramble up the easily angled rock to a ledge. From the ledge climb the corner with the off width crack which leads to a short left tending ramp, climb the crack behind the ramp to the top. Or more easily follow the ramp. Fire Certificate (S 4a) 18m This climb is found in the center of the \"Pine Tree Ledge\" area. Start at a V groove in the rock and bridge up for 4m without protection on good holds. Clamber up the groove or the arête to top out on pine tree ledge, belay from the tree with backup. Fire Certificate \"Alternate Start\" (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy, An alternative start that is a bit shorter but has some protection available in the wide crack that makes up the start. Two meters to the right of the \"V-groove corner\" start of \"Fire Certificate\" scramble up the small earth bank. Climb the crack, tend left at the top of the crack to join fire cert. Navicula (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy Starts just to the right of Fire Cert Alt Start, climb the cracks on the right, which brings you out onto the open face, climb the face up to the pine tree. Dat Dere (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy, Start just left of the \"roof\" which is close to the ground, climb behind the tree and follow the righthand tending crack, belay from top out or continue up and left to the pine tree. Scram Bull (D 3a)15m Niall S. Murphy, Easy line that can be used to get up or down pine tree ledge. ===Middle Yurt=== A section of the crag with easier angled slabs and ledges between \"pine tree ledge\" and \"the northside\". Midshift Madness (S 4a) 23m Niall S. Murphy, Alan Fogarty Starts three meters to the left of \"The Gabhar\", once the first ledge is reached trend left until the steeper slab is reached. Climb left side of the slab to a ledge, move up the groove to the right of the arete. The Gabhar (S 4a) 22m Starts on the right side of \"middle yurt\" just to the right of the rhododendron tree growing at the base, climb the obvious gully to the first ledge, then continue up the gully towards the crux where the face steepens before another ledge, from the ledge tend right to the short corner, climb this to top out. ===Northside=== Northside Topo (left end): Three Piece Sweet (S 4a) 30m, 2 pitches PR: M Go to the left of De Northside face past “Sharran’s Craic” for 15m till you come to an 8m high detached pinnacle which has a pointed 1m high rock coming out from the ground at the base of it. 1. (4a) At the left end of the pinnacle is a cave and a tree beside it. Climb up onto the arête and continue to top of pinnacle. Step left onto a ramp which trends up leftwards until you come to a point where you can step up right to climb straight up on the slab to an angled grassy area (thread belay). 2. (3c) Move right to cross underneath the roof above and then climb up the crack on the right of it to the top. Variation The Sofa Start (HS 4b) PR: P Start at the right side of the base of the pinnacle and step onto the detached rock. From here step onto the pinnacle and up delicately trending left to the left arête and to the top of the pinnacle. PR: P No protection for this section hence HS 4b rating. Captain Planet (VS 4c) 25m Climb the slightly overhanging crack in the pinnacle. Join Three Piece Sweet and follow it until the overhang below the headwall. Arrange gear and climb up the corner. Move diagonally right up the head wall with interest to the top. . Sharran’s Craic (VS 4c) 24m Walk 4m to the left of The Snapper and you will see a vertical crack in the face, this is the start of the climb. The bouldery start is the crux of the climb and you must move up on small flakes and edges above the protection to reach easier holds. Climb the crack above until it finishes and then move left 2 meters into a V shaped short gully and climb this. From the top of the gully trend right over easier ledges following the cleaned rock to a crack, climb the crack and follow the obvious route to the easy finish. Nicky Place (Diff) 6m to the left of the snapper you come to an alcove, climb this on the left side then right at 6m up the crack to the right of “Sharran’s Craic”. Finish as for “Sharran’s Craic”. Sail of the Sentry (VS 4b)** 16m Access the start by scrambling up the first 3m of The Snapper and moving a few metres left, along the grassy ledge, to the shallow ‘sentry box’ in the corner. The climb starts here. Move to the top of the sentry box, reach out and climb right and up onto a narrow ledge. Using the groove on the left, move up easily on good holds to the larger ledge above. Move over right to just left of a diagonal crack (possible long runner) and climb boldly leftwards & up with a delicate move (crux) to finish (escape possible to the left before tackling the crux). The Snapper (VS 4c)*** 25m Immediately in front of the entrance tunnel to De Northside face you will see a large (3m high) triangular block detached from the face, this is the start of the climb. Climb up the block on easy holds and stand on the top, place protection in the flake above and step up, follow the flake left until it peters out. Clamber on to the top (crux) of the flake (subtle move) and reach into the scoop for an excellent hand hold, place protection on your left and move up the slab on crimps and small pockets trending rightwards. Aim for vertical righthand crack above and move up this to finish up over blocky slab to belay point. Sin Binn (E1 5b)** 23m The climb starts 3m to the right of the detached block of the snapper. Start by following the fine vertical crack up to the small ledges, just above head height. Move left by using sidepulls and a high step to the ledge on the small outside corner (crux). Using small holds above continue up the vertical face until better holds appear before gaining the grassy ledge, scramble up over easier ground to the top. Georgie Burgess (VS 4c)* 21m Follow the obvious groove to the bulge. The bulge provides the crux of the route and can be protected by small wires. Tricky moves lead to a high jug which helps you mount the bulge onto the small slab above. Continue up the slab to blockier ground. Me Tarzan, You Insane! (S 4a) 20m PR: M/G A couple of metres to the right of De Northside face entrance is a distinct inset alcove just above head height. Climb straight up the inverted triangular face just to the right of this and make a a delicate push up to gain easier ground. Climb the obvious crack in the short face on your left (great view over the top), scramble across easy ground to the face on the left side and climb the diagonal crack with a delicate move to finish (crux). PR: M/G – Protection is good but for delicate step up near the start of the climb gear is below your feet (or over 1m away on a long runner tucked around the corner in the alcove higher up on the left if you wish). The Budgie Has Landed (S 4a) 22m PR: G Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. Climb goes up left side of the obvious slab, then briefly across vegetated gully and up the obvious alcove on the left at the top. Climb up triangular block (no gear but straightforward) and initially move up right (for a cam placement if you don’t want a long ‘run in’). Strike leftward to follow clear thin diagonal crack running up the left side. Follow this as far as protection/bravery takes you and then cross grassy gully to alcove on the left with a protruding block overhead. Climb up alcove on the right to finish. (Challenge is to stay on the rock and off the grassy gully on your left). The Budgie {Bites Back} (VS 4c) 20 mtrs PR: G° New finish in { } Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top. The Commitment {Direct}** (HS 4b) 20 mtrs PR: G New finish in { } Start on the 2 mtr high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

Murphy Scramble up onto the ledge to the left of the start of snotser, climb the short slab to gain the ledge below the steep wall, the climb goes up the obvious finger crack. Snotser (HS 4b)18m Niall S. Murphy, Rafal Barszczak Scramble up the easily angled rock to a ledge. From the ledge climb the corner with the off width crack which leads to a short left tending ramp, climb the crack behind the ramp to the top. Or more easily follow the ramp. Fire Certificate (S 4a) 18m This climb is found in the center of the \"Pine Tree Ledge\" area. Start at a V groove in the rock and bridge up for 4m without protection on good holds. Clamber up the groove or the arête to top out on pine tree ledge, belay from the tree with backup. Fire Certificate \"Alternate Start\" (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy, An alternative start that is a bit shorter but has some protection available in the wide crack that makes up the start. Two meters to the right of the \"V-groove corner\" start of \"Fire Certificate\" scramble up the small earth bank. Climb the crack, tend left at the top of the crack to join fire cert. Navicula (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy Starts just to the right of Fire Cert Alt Start, climb the cracks on the right, which brings you out onto the open face, climb the face up to the pine tree. Dat Dere (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy, Start just left of the \"roof\" which is close to the ground, climb behind the tree and follow the righthand tending crack, belay from top out or continue up and left to the pine tree. Scram Bull (D 3a)15m Niall S. Murphy, Easy line that can be used to get up or down pine tree ledge. ===Middle Yurt=== A section of the crag with easier angled slabs and ledges between \"pine tree ledge\" and \"the northside\". Midshift Madness (S 4a) 23m Niall S. Murphy, Alan Fogarty Starts three meters to the left of \"The Gabhar\", once the first ledge is reached trend left until the steeper slab is reached. Climb left side of the slab to a ledge, move up the groove to the right of the arete. The Gabhar (S 4a) 22m Starts on the right side of \"middle yurt\" just to the right of the rhododendron tree growing at the base, climb the obvious gully to the first ledge, then continue up the gully towards the crux where the face steepens before another ledge, from the ledge tend right to the short corner, climb this to top out. ===Northside=== Northside Topo (left end): Three Piece Sweet (S 4a) 30m, 2 pitches PR: M Go to the left of De Northside face past “Sharran’s Craic” for 15m till you come to an 8m high detached pinnacle which has a pointed 1m high rock coming out from the ground at the base of it. 1. (4a) At the left end of the pinnacle is a cave and a tree beside it. Climb up onto the arête and continue to top of pinnacle. Step left onto a ramp which trends up leftwards until you come to a point where you can step up right to climb straight up on the slab to an angled grassy area (thread belay). 2. (3c) Move right to cross underneath the roof above and then climb up the crack on the right of it to the top. Variation The Sofa Start (HS 4b) PR: P Start at the right side of the base of the pinnacle and step onto the detached rock. From here step onto the pinnacle and up delicately trending left to the left arête and to the top of the pinnacle. PR: P No protection for this section hence HS 4b rating. Captain Planet (VS 4c) 25m Climb the slightly overhanging crack in the pinnacle. Join Three Piece Sweet and follow it until the overhang below the headwall. Arrange gear and climb up the corner. Move diagonally right up the head wall with interest to the top. . Sharran’s Craic (VS 4c) 24m Walk 4m to the left of The Snapper and you will see a vertical crack in the face, this is the start of the climb. The bouldery start is the crux of the climb and you must move up on small flakes and edges above the protection to reach easier holds. Climb the crack above until it finishes and then move left 2 meters into a V shaped short gully and climb this. From the top of the gully trend right over easier ledges following the cleaned rock to a crack, climb the crack and follow the obvious route to the easy finish. Nicky Place (Diff) 6m to the left of the snapper you come to an alcove, climb this on the left side then right at 6m up the crack to the right of “Sharran’s Craic”. Finish as for “Sharran’s Craic”. Sail of the Sentry (VS 4b)** 16m Access the start by scrambling up the first 3m of The Snapper and moving a few metres left, along the grassy ledge, to the shallow ‘sentry box’ in the corner. The climb starts here. Move to the top of the sentry box, reach out and climb right and up onto a narrow ledge. Using the groove on the left, move up easily on good holds to the larger ledge above. Move over right to just left of a diagonal crack (possible long runner) and climb boldly leftwards & up with a delicate move (crux) to finish (escape possible to the left before tackling the crux). The Snapper (VS 4c)*** 25m Immediately in front of the entrance tunnel to De Northside face you will see a large (3m high) triangular block detached from the face, this is the start of the climb. Climb up the block on easy holds and stand on the top, place protection in the flake above and step up, follow the flake left until it peters out. Clamber on to the top (crux) of the flake (subtle move) and reach into the scoop for an excellent hand hold, place protection on your left and move up the slab on crimps and small pockets trending rightwards. Aim for vertical righthand crack above and move up this to finish up over blocky slab to belay point. Sin Binn (E1 5b)** 23m The climb starts 3m to the right of the detached block of the snapper. Start by following the fine vertical crack up to the small ledges, just above head height. Move left by using sidepulls and a high step to the ledge on the small outside corner (crux). Using small holds above continue up the vertical face until better holds appear before gaining the grassy ledge, scramble up over easier ground to the top. Georgie Burgess (VS 4c)* 21m Follow the obvious groove to the bulge. The bulge provides the crux of the route and can be protected by small wires. Tricky moves lead to a high jug which helps you mount the bulge onto the small slab above. Continue up the slab to blockier ground. Me Tarzan, You Insane! (S 4a) 20m PR: M/G A couple of metres to the right of De Northside face entrance is a distinct inset alcove just above head height. Climb straight up the inverted triangular face just to the right of this and make a a delicate push up to gain easier ground. Climb the obvious crack in the short face on your left (great view over the top), scramble across easy ground to the face on the left side and climb the diagonal crack with a delicate move to finish (crux). PR: M/G – Protection is good but for delicate step up near the start of the climb gear is below your feet (or over 1m away on a long runner tucked around the corner in the alcove higher up on the left if you wish). The Budgie Has Landed (S 4a) 22m PR: G Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. Climb goes up left side of the obvious slab, then briefly across vegetated gully and up the obvious alcove on the left at the top. Climb up triangular block (no gear but straightforward) and initially move up right (for a cam placement if you don’t want a long ‘run in’). Strike leftward to follow clear thin diagonal crack running up the left side. Follow this as far as protection/bravery takes you and then cross grassy gully to alcove on the left with a protruding block overhead. Climb up alcove on the right to finish. (Challenge is to stay on the rock and off the grassy gully on your left). The Budgie {Bites Back} (VS 4c) 20 mtrs PR: G° New finish in { } Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top. The Commitment {Direct}** (HS 4b) 20 mtrs PR: G New finish in { } Start on the 2 mtr high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

            "description": "Niall S. Murphy Scramble up onto the ledge to the left of the start of snotser, climb the short slab to gain the ledge below the steep wall, the climb goes up the obvious finger crack. Snotser (HS 4b)18m Niall S. Murphy, Rafal Barszczak Scramble up the easily angled rock to a ledge. From the ledge climb the corner with the off width crack which leads to a short left tending ramp, climb the crack behind the ramp to the top. Or more easily follow the ramp. Fire Certificate (S 4a) 18m This climb is found in the center of the \"Pine Tree Ledge\" area. Start at a V groove in the rock and bridge up for 4m without protection on good holds. Clamber up the groove or the arête to top out on pine tree ledge, belay from the tree with backup. Fire Certificate \"Alternate Start\" (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy, An alternative start that is a bit shorter but has some protection available in the wide crack that makes up the start. Two meters to the right of the \"V-groove corner\" start of \"Fire Certificate\" scramble up the small earth bank. Climb the crack, tend left at the top of the crack to join fire cert. Navicula (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy Starts just to the right of Fire Cert Alt Start, climb the cracks on the right, which brings you out onto the open face, climb the face up to the pine tree. Dat Dere (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy, Start just left of the \"roof\" which is close to the ground, climb behind the tree and follow the righthand tending crack, belay from top out or continue up and left to the pine tree. Scram Bull (D 3a)15m Niall S. Murphy, Easy line that can be used to get up or down pine tree ledge. ===Middle Yurt=== A section of the crag with easier angled slabs and ledges between \"pine tree ledge\" and \"the northside\". Midshift Madness (S 4a) 23m Niall S. Murphy, Alan Fogarty Starts three meters to the left of \"The Gabhar\", once the first ledge is reached trend left until the steeper slab is reached. Climb left side of the slab to a ledge, move up the groove to the right of the arete. The Gabhar (S 4a) 22m Starts on the right side of \"middle yurt\" just to the right of the rhododendron tree growing at the base, climb the obvious gully to the first ledge, then continue up the gully towards the crux where the face steepens before another ledge, from the ledge tend right to the short corner, climb this to top out. ===Northside=== Northside Topo (left end): Three Piece Sweet (S 4a) 30m, 2 pitches PR: M Go to the left of De Northside face past “Sharran’s Craic” for 15m till you come to an 8m high detached pinnacle which has a pointed 1m high rock coming out from the ground at the base of it. 1. (4a) At the left end of the pinnacle is a cave and a tree beside it. Climb up onto the arête and continue to top of pinnacle. Step left onto a ramp which trends up leftwards until you come to a point where you can step up right to climb straight up on the slab to an angled grassy area (thread belay). 2. (3c) Move right to cross underneath the roof above and then climb up the crack on the right of it to the top. Variation The Sofa Start (HS 4b) PR: P Start at the right side of the base of the pinnacle and step onto the detached rock. From here step onto the pinnacle and up delicately trending left to the left arête and to the top of the pinnacle. PR: P No protection for this section hence HS 4b rating. Captain Planet (VS 4c) 25m Climb the slightly overhanging crack in the pinnacle. Join Three Piece Sweet and follow it until the overhang below the headwall. Arrange gear and climb up the corner. Move diagonally right up the head wall with interest to the top. . Sharran’s Craic (VS 4c) 24m Walk 4m to the left of The Snapper and you will see a vertical crack in the face, this is the start of the climb. The bouldery start is the crux of the climb and you must move up on small flakes and edges above the protection to reach easier holds. Climb the crack above until it finishes and then move left 2 meters into a V shaped short gully and climb this. From the top of the gully trend right over easier ledges following the cleaned rock to a crack, climb the crack and follow the obvious route to the easy finish. Nicky Place (Diff) 6m to the left of the snapper you come to an alcove, climb this on the left side then right at 6m up the crack to the right of “Sharran’s Craic”. Finish as for “Sharran’s Craic”. Sail of the Sentry (VS 4b)** 16m Access the start by scrambling up the first 3m of The Snapper and moving a few metres left, along the grassy ledge, to the shallow ‘sentry box’ in the corner. The climb starts here. Move to the top of the sentry box, reach out and climb right and up onto a narrow ledge. Using the groove on the left, move up easily on good holds to the larger ledge above. Move over right to just left of a diagonal crack (possible long runner) and climb boldly leftwards & up with a delicate move (crux) to finish (escape possible to the left before tackling the crux). The Snapper (VS 4c)*** 25m Immediately in front of the entrance tunnel to De Northside face you will see a large (3m high) triangular block detached from the face, this is the start of the climb. Climb up the block on easy holds and stand on the top, place protection in the flake above and step up, follow the flake left until it peters out. Clamber on to the top (crux) of the flake (subtle move) and reach into the scoop for an excellent hand hold, place protection on your left and move up the slab on crimps and small pockets trending rightwards. Aim for vertical righthand crack above and move up this to finish up over blocky slab to belay point. Sin Binn (E1 5b)** 23m The climb starts 3m to the right of the detached block of the snapper. Start by following the fine vertical crack up to the small ledges, just above head height. Move left by using sidepulls and a high step to the ledge on the small outside corner (crux). Using small holds above continue up the vertical face until better holds appear before gaining the grassy ledge, scramble up over easier ground to the top. Georgie Burgess (VS 4c)* 21m Follow the obvious groove to the bulge. The bulge provides the crux of the route and can be protected by small wires. Tricky moves lead to a high jug which helps you mount the bulge onto the small slab above. Continue up the slab to blockier ground. Me Tarzan, You Insane! (S 4a) 20m PR: M/G A couple of metres to the right of De Northside face entrance is a distinct inset alcove just above head height. Climb straight up the inverted triangular face just to the right of this and make a a delicate push up to gain easier ground. Climb the obvious crack in the short face on your left (great view over the top), scramble across easy ground to the face on the left side and climb the diagonal crack with a delicate move to finish (crux). PR: M/G – Protection is good but for delicate step up near the start of the climb gear is below your feet (or over 1m away on a long runner tucked around the corner in the alcove higher up on the left if you wish). The Budgie Has Landed (S 4a) 22m PR: G Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. Climb goes up left side of the obvious slab, then briefly across vegetated gully and up the obvious alcove on the left at the top. Climb up triangular block (no gear but straightforward) and initially move up right (for a cam placement if you don’t want a long ‘run in’). Strike leftward to follow clear thin diagonal crack running up the left side. Follow this as far as protection/bravery takes you and then cross grassy gully to alcove on the left with a protruding block overhead. Climb up alcove on the right to finish. (Challenge is to stay on the rock and off the grassy gully on your left). The Budgie {Bites Back} (VS 4c) 20 mtrs PR: G° New finish in { } Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top. The Commitment {Direct}** (HS 4b) 20 mtrs PR: G New finish in { } Start on the 2 mtr high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

From the ledge climb the corner with the off width crack which leads to a short left tending ramp, climb the crack behind the ramp to the top. Or more easily follow the ramp. Fire Certificate (S 4a) 18m This climb is found in the center of the \"Pine Tree Ledge\" area. Start at a V groove in the rock and bridge up for 4m without protection on good holds. Clamber up the groove or the arête to top out on pine tree ledge, belay from the tree with backup. Fire Certificate \"Alternate Start\" (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy, An alternative start that is a bit shorter but has some protection available in the wide crack that makes up the start. Two meters to the right of the \"V-groove corner\" start of \"Fire Certificate\" scramble up the small earth bank. Climb the crack, tend left at the top of the crack to join fire cert. Navicula (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy Starts just to the right of Fire Cert Alt Start, climb the cracks on the right, which brings you out onto the open face, climb the face up to the pine tree. Dat Dere (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy, Start just left of the \"roof\" which is close to the ground, climb behind the tree and follow the righthand tending crack, belay from top out or continue up and left to the pine tree. Scram Bull (D 3a)15m Niall S. Murphy, Easy line that can be used to get up or down pine tree ledge. ===Middle Yurt=== A section of the crag with easier angled slabs and ledges between \"pine tree ledge\" and \"the northside\". Midshift Madness (S 4a) 23m Niall S. Murphy, Alan Fogarty Starts three meters to the left of \"The Gabhar\", once the first ledge is reached trend left until the steeper slab is reached. Climb left side of the slab to a ledge, move up the groove to the right of the arete. The Gabhar (S 4a) 22m Starts on the right side of \"middle yurt\" just to the right of the rhododendron tree growing at the base, climb the obvious gully to the first ledge, then continue up the gully towards the crux where the face steepens before another ledge, from the ledge tend right to the short corner, climb this to top out. ===Northside=== Northside Topo (left end): Three Piece Sweet (S 4a) 30m, 2 pitches PR: M Go to the left of De Northside face past “Sharran’s Craic” for 15m till you come to an 8m high detached pinnacle which has a pointed 1m high rock coming out from the ground at the base of it. 1. (4a) At the left end of the pinnacle is a cave and a tree beside it. Climb up onto the arête and continue to top of pinnacle. Step left onto a ramp which trends up leftwards until you come to a point where you can step up right to climb straight up on the slab to an angled grassy area (thread belay). 2. (3c) Move right to cross underneath the roof above and then climb up the crack on the right of it to the top. Variation The Sofa Start (HS 4b) PR: P Start at the right side of the base of the pinnacle and step onto the detached rock. From here step onto the pinnacle and up delicately trending left to the left arête and to the top of the pinnacle. PR: P No protection for this section hence HS 4b rating. Captain Planet (VS 4c) 25m Climb the slightly overhanging crack in the pinnacle. Join Three Piece Sweet and follow it until the overhang below the headwall. Arrange gear and climb up the corner. Move diagonally right up the head wall with interest to the top. . Sharran’s Craic (VS 4c) 24m Walk 4m to the left of The Snapper and you will see a vertical crack in the face, this is the start of the climb. The bouldery start is the crux of the climb and you must move up on small flakes and edges above the protection to reach easier holds. Climb the crack above until it finishes and then move left 2 meters into a V shaped short gully and climb this. From the top of the gully trend right over easier ledges following the cleaned rock to a crack, climb the crack and follow the obvious route to the easy finish. Nicky Place (Diff) 6m to the left of the snapper you come to an alcove, climb this on the left side then right at 6m up the crack to the right of “Sharran’s Craic”. Finish as for “Sharran’s Craic”. Sail of the Sentry (VS 4b)** 16m Access the start by scrambling up the first 3m of The Snapper and moving a few metres left, along the grassy ledge, to the shallow ‘sentry box’ in the corner. The climb starts here. Move to the top of the sentry box, reach out and climb right and up onto a narrow ledge. Using the groove on the left, move up easily on good holds to the larger ledge above. Move over right to just left of a diagonal crack (possible long runner) and climb boldly leftwards & up with a delicate move (crux) to finish (escape possible to the left before tackling the crux). The Snapper (VS 4c)*** 25m Immediately in front of the entrance tunnel to De Northside face you will see a large (3m high) triangular block detached from the face, this is the start of the climb. Climb up the block on easy holds and stand on the top, place protection in the flake above and step up, follow the flake left until it peters out. Clamber on to the top (crux) of the flake (subtle move) and reach into the scoop for an excellent hand hold, place protection on your left and move up the slab on crimps and small pockets trending rightwards. Aim for vertical righthand crack above and move up this to finish up over blocky slab to belay point. Sin Binn (E1 5b)** 23m The climb starts 3m to the right of the detached block of the snapper. Start by following the fine vertical crack up to the small ledges, just above head height. Move left by using sidepulls and a high step to the ledge on the small outside corner (crux). Using small holds above continue up the vertical face until better holds appear before gaining the grassy ledge, scramble up over easier ground to the top. Georgie Burgess (VS 4c)* 21m Follow the obvious groove to the bulge. The bulge provides the crux of the route and can be protected by small wires. Tricky moves lead to a high jug which helps you mount the bulge onto the small slab above. Continue up the slab to blockier ground. Me Tarzan, You Insane! (S 4a) 20m PR: M/G A couple of metres to the right of De Northside face entrance is a distinct inset alcove just above head height. Climb straight up the inverted triangular face just to the right of this and make a a delicate push up to gain easier ground. Climb the obvious crack in the short face on your left (great view over the top), scramble across easy ground to the face on the left side and climb the diagonal crack with a delicate move to finish (crux). PR: M/G – Protection is good but for delicate step up near the start of the climb gear is below your feet (or over 1m away on a long runner tucked around the corner in the alcove higher up on the left if you wish). The Budgie Has Landed (S 4a) 22m PR: G Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. Climb goes up left side of the obvious slab, then briefly across vegetated gully and up the obvious alcove on the left at the top. Climb up triangular block (no gear but straightforward) and initially move up right (for a cam placement if you don’t want a long ‘run in’). Strike leftward to follow clear thin diagonal crack running up the left side. Follow this as far as protection/bravery takes you and then cross grassy gully to alcove on the left with a protruding block overhead. Climb up alcove on the right to finish. (Challenge is to stay on the rock and off the grassy gully on your left). The Budgie {Bites Back} (VS 4c) 20 mtrs PR: G° New finish in { } Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top. The Commitment {Direct}** (HS 4b) 20 mtrs PR: G New finish in { } Start on the 2 mtr high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

Clamber up the groove or the arête to top out on pine tree ledge, belay from the tree with backup. Fire Certificate \"Alternate Start\" (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy, An alternative start that is a bit shorter but has some protection available in the wide crack that makes up the start. Two meters to the right of the \"V-groove corner\" start of \"Fire Certificate\" scramble up the small earth bank. Climb the crack, tend left at the top of the crack to join fire cert. Navicula (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy Starts just to the right of Fire Cert Alt Start, climb the cracks on the right, which brings you out onto the open face, climb the face up to the pine tree. Dat Dere (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy, Start just left of the \"roof\" which is close to the ground, climb behind the tree and follow the righthand tending crack, belay from top out or continue up and left to the pine tree. Scram Bull (D 3a)15m Niall S. Murphy, Easy line that can be used to get up or down pine tree ledge. ===Middle Yurt=== A section of the crag with easier angled slabs and ledges between \"pine tree ledge\" and \"the northside\". Midshift Madness (S 4a) 23m Niall S. Murphy, Alan Fogarty Starts three meters to the left of \"The Gabhar\", once the first ledge is reached trend left until the steeper slab is reached. Climb left side of the slab to a ledge, move up the groove to the right of the arete. The Gabhar (S 4a) 22m Starts on the right side of \"middle yurt\" just to the right of the rhododendron tree growing at the base, climb the obvious gully to the first ledge, then continue up the gully towards the crux where the face steepens before another ledge, from the ledge tend right to the short corner, climb this to top out. ===Northside=== Northside Topo (left end): Three Piece Sweet (S 4a) 30m, 2 pitches PR: M Go to the left of De Northside face past “Sharran’s Craic” for 15m till you come to an 8m high detached pinnacle which has a pointed 1m high rock coming out from the ground at the base of it. 1. (4a) At the left end of the pinnacle is a cave and a tree beside it. Climb up onto the arête and continue to top of pinnacle. Step left onto a ramp which trends up leftwards until you come to a point where you can step up right to climb straight up on the slab to an angled grassy area (thread belay). 2. (3c) Move right to cross underneath the roof above and then climb up the crack on the right of it to the top. Variation The Sofa Start (HS 4b) PR: P Start at the right side of the base of the pinnacle and step onto the detached rock. From here step onto the pinnacle and up delicately trending left to the left arête and to the top of the pinnacle. PR: P No protection for this section hence HS 4b rating. Captain Planet (VS 4c) 25m Climb the slightly overhanging crack in the pinnacle. Join Three Piece Sweet and follow it until the overhang below the headwall. Arrange gear and climb up the corner. Move diagonally right up the head wall with interest to the top. . Sharran’s Craic (VS 4c) 24m Walk 4m to the left of The Snapper and you will see a vertical crack in the face, this is the start of the climb. The bouldery start is the crux of the climb and you must move up on small flakes and edges above the protection to reach easier holds. Climb the crack above until it finishes and then move left 2 meters into a V shaped short gully and climb this. From the top of the gully trend right over easier ledges following the cleaned rock to a crack, climb the crack and follow the obvious route to the easy finish. Nicky Place (Diff) 6m to the left of the snapper you come to an alcove, climb this on the left side then right at 6m up the crack to the right of “Sharran’s Craic”. Finish as for “Sharran’s Craic”. Sail of the Sentry (VS 4b)** 16m Access the start by scrambling up the first 3m of The Snapper and moving a few metres left, along the grassy ledge, to the shallow ‘sentry box’ in the corner. The climb starts here. Move to the top of the sentry box, reach out and climb right and up onto a narrow ledge. Using the groove on the left, move up easily on good holds to the larger ledge above. Move over right to just left of a diagonal crack (possible long runner) and climb boldly leftwards & up with a delicate move (crux) to finish (escape possible to the left before tackling the crux). The Snapper (VS 4c)*** 25m Immediately in front of the entrance tunnel to De Northside face you will see a large (3m high) triangular block detached from the face, this is the start of the climb. Climb up the block on easy holds and stand on the top, place protection in the flake above and step up, follow the flake left until it peters out. Clamber on to the top (crux) of the flake (subtle move) and reach into the scoop for an excellent hand hold, place protection on your left and move up the slab on crimps and small pockets trending rightwards. Aim for vertical righthand crack above and move up this to finish up over blocky slab to belay point. Sin Binn (E1 5b)** 23m The climb starts 3m to the right of the detached block of the snapper. Start by following the fine vertical crack up to the small ledges, just above head height. Move left by using sidepulls and a high step to the ledge on the small outside corner (crux). Using small holds above continue up the vertical face until better holds appear before gaining the grassy ledge, scramble up over easier ground to the top. Georgie Burgess (VS 4c)* 21m Follow the obvious groove to the bulge. The bulge provides the crux of the route and can be protected by small wires. Tricky moves lead to a high jug which helps you mount the bulge onto the small slab above. Continue up the slab to blockier ground. Me Tarzan, You Insane! (S 4a) 20m PR: M/G A couple of metres to the right of De Northside face entrance is a distinct inset alcove just above head height. Climb straight up the inverted triangular face just to the right of this and make a a delicate push up to gain easier ground. Climb the obvious crack in the short face on your left (great view over the top), scramble across easy ground to the face on the left side and climb the diagonal crack with a delicate move to finish (crux). PR: M/G – Protection is good but for delicate step up near the start of the climb gear is below your feet (or over 1m away on a long runner tucked around the corner in the alcove higher up on the left if you wish). The Budgie Has Landed (S 4a) 22m PR: G Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. Climb goes up left side of the obvious slab, then briefly across vegetated gully and up the obvious alcove on the left at the top. Climb up triangular block (no gear but straightforward) and initially move up right (for a cam placement if you don’t want a long ‘run in’). Strike leftward to follow clear thin diagonal crack running up the left side. Follow this as far as protection/bravery takes you and then cross grassy gully to alcove on the left with a protruding block overhead. Climb up alcove on the right to finish. (Challenge is to stay on the rock and off the grassy gully on your left). The Budgie {Bites Back} (VS 4c) 20 mtrs PR: G° New finish in { } Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top. The Commitment {Direct}** (HS 4b) 20 mtrs PR: G New finish in { } Start on the 2 mtr high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

Two meters to the right of the \"V-groove corner\" start of \"Fire Certificate\" scramble up the small earth bank. Climb the crack, tend left at the top of the crack to join fire cert. Navicula (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy Starts just to the right of Fire Cert Alt Start, climb the cracks on the right, which brings you out onto the open face, climb the face up to the pine tree. Dat Dere (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy, Start just left of the \"roof\" which is close to the ground, climb behind the tree and follow the righthand tending crack, belay from top out or continue up and left to the pine tree. Scram Bull (D 3a)15m Niall S. Murphy, Easy line that can be used to get up or down pine tree ledge. ===Middle Yurt=== A section of the crag with easier angled slabs and ledges between \"pine tree ledge\" and \"the northside\". Midshift Madness (S 4a) 23m Niall S. Murphy, Alan Fogarty Starts three meters to the left of \"The Gabhar\", once the first ledge is reached trend left until the steeper slab is reached. Climb left side of the slab to a ledge, move up the groove to the right of the arete. The Gabhar (S 4a) 22m Starts on the right side of \"middle yurt\" just to the right of the rhododendron tree growing at the base, climb the obvious gully to the first ledge, then continue up the gully towards the crux where the face steepens before another ledge, from the ledge tend right to the short corner, climb this to top out. ===Northside=== Northside Topo (left end): Three Piece Sweet (S 4a) 30m, 2 pitches PR: M Go to the left of De Northside face past “Sharran’s Craic” for 15m till you come to an 8m high detached pinnacle which has a pointed 1m high rock coming out from the ground at the base of it. 1. (4a) At the left end of the pinnacle is a cave and a tree beside it. Climb up onto the arête and continue to top of pinnacle. Step left onto a ramp which trends up leftwards until you come to a point where you can step up right to climb straight up on the slab to an angled grassy area (thread belay). 2. (3c) Move right to cross underneath the roof above and then climb up the crack on the right of it to the top. Variation The Sofa Start (HS 4b) PR: P Start at the right side of the base of the pinnacle and step onto the detached rock. From here step onto the pinnacle and up delicately trending left to the left arête and to the top of the pinnacle. PR: P No protection for this section hence HS 4b rating. Captain Planet (VS 4c) 25m Climb the slightly overhanging crack in the pinnacle. Join Three Piece Sweet and follow it until the overhang below the headwall. Arrange gear and climb up the corner. Move diagonally right up the head wall with interest to the top. . Sharran’s Craic (VS 4c) 24m Walk 4m to the left of The Snapper and you will see a vertical crack in the face, this is the start of the climb. The bouldery start is the crux of the climb and you must move up on small flakes and edges above the protection to reach easier holds. Climb the crack above until it finishes and then move left 2 meters into a V shaped short gully and climb this. From the top of the gully trend right over easier ledges following the cleaned rock to a crack, climb the crack and follow the obvious route to the easy finish. Nicky Place (Diff) 6m to the left of the snapper you come to an alcove, climb this on the left side then right at 6m up the crack to the right of “Sharran’s Craic”. Finish as for “Sharran’s Craic”. Sail of the Sentry (VS 4b)** 16m Access the start by scrambling up the first 3m of The Snapper and moving a few metres left, along the grassy ledge, to the shallow ‘sentry box’ in the corner. The climb starts here. Move to the top of the sentry box, reach out and climb right and up onto a narrow ledge. Using the groove on the left, move up easily on good holds to the larger ledge above. Move over right to just left of a diagonal crack (possible long runner) and climb boldly leftwards & up with a delicate move (crux) to finish (escape possible to the left before tackling the crux). The Snapper (VS 4c)*** 25m Immediately in front of the entrance tunnel to De Northside face you will see a large (3m high) triangular block detached from the face, this is the start of the climb. Climb up the block on easy holds and stand on the top, place protection in the flake above and step up, follow the flake left until it peters out. Clamber on to the top (crux) of the flake (subtle move) and reach into the scoop for an excellent hand hold, place protection on your left and move up the slab on crimps and small pockets trending rightwards. Aim for vertical righthand crack above and move up this to finish up over blocky slab to belay point. Sin Binn (E1 5b)** 23m The climb starts 3m to the right of the detached block of the snapper. Start by following the fine vertical crack up to the small ledges, just above head height. Move left by using sidepulls and a high step to the ledge on the small outside corner (crux). Using small holds above continue up the vertical face until better holds appear before gaining the grassy ledge, scramble up over easier ground to the top. Georgie Burgess (VS 4c)* 21m Follow the obvious groove to the bulge. The bulge provides the crux of the route and can be protected by small wires. Tricky moves lead to a high jug which helps you mount the bulge onto the small slab above. Continue up the slab to blockier ground. Me Tarzan, You Insane! (S 4a) 20m PR: M/G A couple of metres to the right of De Northside face entrance is a distinct inset alcove just above head height. Climb straight up the inverted triangular face just to the right of this and make a a delicate push up to gain easier ground. Climb the obvious crack in the short face on your left (great view over the top), scramble across easy ground to the face on the left side and climb the diagonal crack with a delicate move to finish (crux). PR: M/G – Protection is good but for delicate step up near the start of the climb gear is below your feet (or over 1m away on a long runner tucked around the corner in the alcove higher up on the left if you wish). The Budgie Has Landed (S 4a) 22m PR: G Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. Climb goes up left side of the obvious slab, then briefly across vegetated gully and up the obvious alcove on the left at the top. Climb up triangular block (no gear but straightforward) and initially move up right (for a cam placement if you don’t want a long ‘run in’). Strike leftward to follow clear thin diagonal crack running up the left side. Follow this as far as protection/bravery takes you and then cross grassy gully to alcove on the left with a protruding block overhead. Climb up alcove on the right to finish. (Challenge is to stay on the rock and off the grassy gully on your left). The Budgie {Bites Back} (VS 4c) 20 mtrs PR: G° New finish in { } Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top. The Commitment {Direct}** (HS 4b) 20 mtrs PR: G New finish in { } Start on the 2 mtr high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes.

            "description": "Pine Tree Ledge Topo: Zambezi Nights (S 4a)12m Niall S. Murphy Start just to the right of \"Cooley Crack\", the climb goes up the corner/gully, good gear. Squawk Code (HS 4b)12m Niall S. Murphy Scramble up onto the ledge to the left of the start of snotser, climb the short slab to gain the ledge below the steep wall, the climb goes up the obvious finger crack. Snotser (HS 4b)18m Niall S. Murphy, Rafal Barszczak Scramble up the easily angled rock to a ledge. From the ledge climb the corner with the off width crack which leads to a short left tending ramp, climb the crack behind the ramp to the top. Or more easily follow the ramp. Fire Certificate (S 4a) 18m This climb is found in the center of the \"Pine Tree Ledge\" area. Start at a V groove in the rock and bridge up for 4m without protection on good holds. Clamber up the groove or the arête to top out on pine tree ledge, belay from the tree with backup. Fire Certificate \"Alternate Start\" (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy, An alternative start that is a bit shorter but has some protection available in the wide crack that makes up the start. Two meters to the right of the \"V-groove corner\" start of \"Fire Certificate\" scramble up the small earth bank. Climb the crack, tend left at the top of the crack to join fire cert. Navicula (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy Starts just to the right of Fire Cert Alt Start, climb the cracks on the right, which brings you out onto the open face, climb the face up to the pine tree. Dat Dere (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy, Start just left of the \"roof\" which is close to the ground, climb behind the tree and follow the righthand tending crack, belay from top out or continue up and left to the pine tree. Scram Bull (D 3a)15m Niall S. Murphy, Easy line that can be used to get up or down pine tree ledge. ===Middle Yurt=== A section of the crag with easier angled slabs and ledges between \"pine tree ledge\" and \"the northside\". Midshift Madness (S 4a) 23m Niall S. Murphy, Alan Fogarty Starts three meters to the left of \"The Gabhar\", once the first ledge is reached trend left until the steeper slab is reached. Climb left side of the slab to a ledge, move up the groove to the right of the arete. The Gabhar (S 4a) 22m Starts on the right side of \"middle yurt\" just to the right of the rhododendron tree growing at the base, climb the obvious gully to the first ledge, then continue up the gully towards the crux where the face steepens before another ledge, from the ledge tend right to the short corner, climb this to top out. ===Northside=== Northside Topo (left end): Three Piece Sweet (S 4a) 30m, 2 pitches PR: M Go to the left of De Northside face past “Sharran’s Craic” for 15m till you come to an 8m high detached pinnacle which has a pointed 1m high rock coming out from the ground at the base of it. 1. (4a) At the left end of the pinnacle is a cave and a tree beside it. Climb up onto the arête and continue to top of pinnacle. Step left onto a ramp which trends up leftwards until you come to a point where you can step up right to climb straight up on the slab to an angled grassy area (thread belay). 2. (3c) Move right to cross underneath the roof above and then climb up the crack on the right of it to the top. Variation The Sofa Start (HS 4b) PR: P Start at the right side of the base of the pinnacle and step onto the detached rock. From here step onto the pinnacle and up delicately trending left to the left arête and to the top of the pinnacle. PR: P No protection for this section hence HS 4b rating. Captain Planet (VS 4c) 25m Climb the slightly overhanging crack in the pinnacle. Join Three Piece Sweet and follow it until the overhang below the headwall. Arrange gear and climb up the corner. Move diagonally right up the head wall with interest to the top. . Sharran’s Craic (VS 4c) 24m Walk 4m to the left of The Snapper and you will see a vertical crack in the face, this is the start of the climb. The bouldery start is the crux of the climb and you must move up on small flakes and edges above the protection to reach easier holds. Climb the crack above until it finishes and then move left 2 meters into a V shaped short gully and climb this. From the top of the gully trend right over easier ledges following the cleaned rock to a crack, climb the crack and follow the obvious route to the easy finish. Nicky Place (Diff) 6m to the left of the snapper you come to an alcove, climb this on the left side then right at 6m up the crack to the right of “Sharran’s Craic”. Finish as for “Sharran’s Craic”. Sail of the Sentry (VS 4b)** 16m Access the start by scrambling up the first 3m of The Snapper and moving a few metres left, along the grassy ledge, to the shallow ‘sentry box’ in the corner. The climb starts here. Move to the top of the sentry box, reach out and climb right and up onto a narrow ledge. Using the groove on the left, move up easily on good holds to the larger ledge above. Move over right to just left of a diagonal crack (possible long runner) and climb boldly leftwards & up with a delicate move (crux) to finish (escape possible to the left before tackling the crux). The Snapper (VS 4c)*** 25m Immediately in front of the entrance tunnel to De Northside face you will see a large (3m high) triangular block detached from the face, this is the start of the climb. Climb up the block on easy holds and stand on the top, place protection in the flake above and step up, follow the flake left until it peters out. Clamber on to the top (crux) of the flake (subtle move) and reach into the scoop for an excellent hand hold, place protection on your left and move up the slab on crimps and small pockets trending rightwards. Aim for vertical righthand crack above and move up this to finish up over blocky slab to belay point. Sin Binn (E1 5b)** 23m The climb starts 3m to the right of the detached block of the snapper. Start by following the fine vertical crack up to the small ledges, just above head height. Move left by using sidepulls and a high step to the ledge on the small outside corner (crux). Using small holds above continue up the vertical face until better holds appear before gaining the grassy ledge, scramble up over easier ground to the top. Georgie Burgess (VS 4c)* 21m Follow the obvious groove to the bulge. The bulge provides the crux of the route and can be protected by small wires. Tricky moves lead to a high jug which helps you mount the bulge onto the small slab above. Continue up the slab to blockier ground. Me Tarzan, You Insane! (S 4a) 20m PR: M/G A couple of metres to the right of De Northside face entrance is a distinct inset alcove just above head height. Climb straight up the inverted triangular face just to the right of this and make a a delicate push up to gain easier ground. Climb the obvious crack in the short face on your left (great view over the top), scramble across easy ground to the face on the left side and climb the diagonal crack with a delicate move to finish (crux). PR: M/G – Protection is good but for delicate step up near the start of the climb gear is below your feet (or over 1m away on a long runner tucked around the corner in the alcove higher up on the left if you wish). The Budgie Has Landed (S 4a) 22m PR: G Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. Climb goes up left side of the obvious slab, then briefly across vegetated gully and up the obvious alcove on the left at the top. Climb up triangular block (no gear but straightforward) and initially move up right (for a cam placement if you don’t want a long ‘run in’). Strike leftward to follow clear thin diagonal crack running up the left side. Follow this as far as protection/bravery takes you and then cross grassy gully to alcove on the left with a protruding block overhead. Climb up alcove on the right to finish. (Challenge is to stay on the rock and off the grassy gully on your left). The Budgie {Bites Back} (VS 4c) 20 mtrs PR: G° New finish in { } Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top. The Commitment {Direct}** (HS 4b) 20 mtrs PR: G New finish in { } Start on the 2 mtr high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

Scram Bull (D 3a)15m Niall S. Murphy, Easy line that can be used to get up or down pine tree ledge. ===Middle Yurt=== A section of the crag with easier angled slabs and ledges between \"pine tree ledge\" and \"the northside\". Midshift Madness (S 4a) 23m Niall S. Murphy, Alan Fogarty Starts three meters to the left of \"The Gabhar\", once the first ledge is reached trend left until the steeper slab is reached. Climb left side of the slab to a ledge, move up the groove to the right of the arete. The Gabhar (S 4a) 22m Starts on the right side of \"middle yurt\" just to the right of the rhododendron tree growing at the base, climb the obvious gully to the first ledge, then continue up the gully towards the crux where the face steepens before another ledge, from the ledge tend right to the short corner, climb this to top out. ===Northside=== Northside Topo (left end): Three Piece Sweet (S 4a) 30m, 2 pitches PR: M Go to the left of De Northside face past “Sharran’s Craic” for 15m till you come to an 8m high detached pinnacle which has a pointed 1m high rock coming out from the ground at the base of it. 1. (4a) At the left end of the pinnacle is a cave and a tree beside it. Climb up onto the arête and continue to top of pinnacle. Step left onto a ramp which trends up leftwards until you come to a point where you can step up right to climb straight up on the slab to an angled grassy area (thread belay). 2. (3c) Move right to cross underneath the roof above and then climb up the crack on the right of it to the top. Variation The Sofa Start (HS 4b) PR: P Start at the right side of the base of the pinnacle and step onto the detached rock. From here step onto the pinnacle and up delicately trending left to the left arête and to the top of the pinnacle. PR: P No protection for this section hence HS 4b rating. Captain Planet (VS 4c) 25m Climb the slightly overhanging crack in the pinnacle. Join Three Piece Sweet and follow it until the overhang below the headwall. Arrange gear and climb up the corner. Move diagonally right up the head wall with interest to the top. . Sharran’s Craic (VS 4c) 24m Walk 4m to the left of The Snapper and you will see a vertical crack in the face, this is the start of the climb. The bouldery start is the crux of the climb and you must move up on small flakes and edges above the protection to reach easier holds. Climb the crack above until it finishes and then move left 2 meters into a V shaped short gully and climb this. From the top of the gully trend right over easier ledges following the cleaned rock to a crack, climb the crack and follow the obvious route to the easy finish. Nicky Place (Diff) 6m to the left of the snapper you come to an alcove, climb this on the left side then right at 6m up the crack to the right of “Sharran’s Craic”. Finish as for “Sharran’s Craic”. Sail of the Sentry (VS 4b)** 16m Access the start by scrambling up the first 3m of The Snapper and moving a few metres left, along the grassy ledge, to the shallow ‘sentry box’ in the corner. The climb starts here. Move to the top of the sentry box, reach out and climb right and up onto a narrow ledge. Using the groove on the left, move up easily on good holds to the larger ledge above. Move over right to just left of a diagonal crack (possible long runner) and climb boldly leftwards & up with a delicate move (crux) to finish (escape possible to the left before tackling the crux). The Snapper (VS 4c)*** 25m Immediately in front of the entrance tunnel to De Northside face you will see a large (3m high) triangular block detached from the face, this is the start of the climb. Climb up the block on easy holds and stand on the top, place protection in the flake above and step up, follow the flake left until it peters out. Clamber on to the top (crux) of the flake (subtle move) and reach into the scoop for an excellent hand hold, place protection on your left and move up the slab on crimps and small pockets trending rightwards. Aim for vertical righthand crack above and move up this to finish up over blocky slab to belay point. Sin Binn (E1 5b)** 23m The climb starts 3m to the right of the detached block of the snapper. Start by following the fine vertical crack up to the small ledges, just above head height. Move left by using sidepulls and a high step to the ledge on the small outside corner (crux). Using small holds above continue up the vertical face until better holds appear before gaining the grassy ledge, scramble up over easier ground to the top. Georgie Burgess (VS 4c)* 21m Follow the obvious groove to the bulge. The bulge provides the crux of the route and can be protected by small wires. Tricky moves lead to a high jug which helps you mount the bulge onto the small slab above. Continue up the slab to blockier ground. Me Tarzan, You Insane! (S 4a) 20m PR: M/G A couple of metres to the right of De Northside face entrance is a distinct inset alcove just above head height. Climb straight up the inverted triangular face just to the right of this and make a a delicate push up to gain easier ground. Climb the obvious crack in the short face on your left (great view over the top), scramble across easy ground to the face on the left side and climb the diagonal crack with a delicate move to finish (crux). PR: M/G – Protection is good but for delicate step up near the start of the climb gear is below your feet (or over 1m away on a long runner tucked around the corner in the alcove higher up on the left if you wish). The Budgie Has Landed (S 4a) 22m PR: G Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. Climb goes up left side of the obvious slab, then briefly across vegetated gully and up the obvious alcove on the left at the top. Climb up triangular block (no gear but straightforward) and initially move up right (for a cam placement if you don’t want a long ‘run in’). Strike leftward to follow clear thin diagonal crack running up the left side. Follow this as far as protection/bravery takes you and then cross grassy gully to alcove on the left with a protruding block overhead. Climb up alcove on the right to finish. (Challenge is to stay on the rock and off the grassy gully on your left). The Budgie {Bites Back} (VS 4c) 20 mtrs PR: G° New finish in { } Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top. The Commitment {Direct}** (HS 4b) 20 mtrs PR: G New finish in { } Start on the 2 mtr high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

Squawk Code (HS 4b)12m Niall S. Murphy Scramble up onto the ledge to the left of the start of snotser, climb the short slab to gain the ledge below the steep wall, the climb goes up the obvious finger crack. Snotser (HS 4b)18m Niall S. Murphy, Rafal Barszczak Scramble up the easily angled rock to a ledge. From the ledge climb the corner with the off width crack which leads to a short left tending ramp, climb the crack behind the ramp to the top. Or more easily follow the ramp. Fire Certificate (S 4a) 18m This climb is found in the center of the \"Pine Tree Ledge\" area. Start at a V groove in the rock and bridge up for 4m without protection on good holds. Clamber up the groove or the arête to top out on pine tree ledge, belay from the tree with backup. Fire Certificate \"Alternate Start\" (S 4a)15m Niall S. Murphy, An alternative start that is a bit shorter but has some protection available in the wide crack that makes up the start. Two meters to the right of the \"V-groove corner\" start of \"Fire Certificate\" scramble up the small earth bank. Climb the crack, tend left at the top of the crack to join fire cert.

Midshift Madness (S 4a) 23m Niall S. Murphy, Alan Fogarty Starts three meters to the left of \"The Gabhar\", once the first ledge is reached trend left until the steeper slab is reached. Climb left side of the slab to a ledge, move up the groove to the right of the arete. The Gabhar (S 4a) 22m Starts on the right side of \"middle yurt\" just to the right of the rhododendron tree growing at the base, climb the obvious gully to the first ledge, then continue up the gully towards the crux where the face steepens before another ledge, from the ledge tend right to the short corner, climb this to top out. ===Northside=== Northside Topo (left end): Three Piece Sweet (S 4a) 30m, 2 pitches PR: M Go to the left of De Northside face past “Sharran’s Craic” for 15m till you come to an 8m high detached pinnacle which has a pointed 1m high rock coming out from the ground at the base of it. 1. (4a) At the left end of the pinnacle is a cave and a tree beside it. Climb up onto the arête and continue to top of pinnacle. Step left onto a ramp which trends up leftwards until you come to a point where you can step up right to climb straight up on the slab to an angled grassy area (thread belay). 2. (3c) Move right to cross underneath the roof above and then climb up the crack on the right of it to the top. Variation The Sofa Start (HS 4b) PR: P Start at the right side of the base of the pinnacle and step onto the detached rock. From here step onto the pinnacle and up delicately trending left to the left arête and to the top of the pinnacle. PR: P No protection for this section hence HS 4b rating. Captain Planet (VS 4c) 25m Climb the slightly overhanging crack in the pinnacle. Join Three Piece Sweet and follow it until the overhang below the headwall. Arrange gear and climb up the corner. Move diagonally right up the head wall with interest to the top. . Sharran’s Craic (VS 4c) 24m Walk 4m to the left of The Snapper and you will see a vertical crack in the face, this is the start of the climb. The bouldery start is the crux of the climb and you must move up on small flakes and edges above the protection to reach easier holds. Climb the crack above until it finishes and then move left 2 meters into a V shaped short gully and climb this. From the top of the gully trend right over easier ledges following the cleaned rock to a crack, climb the crack and follow the obvious route to the easy finish. Nicky Place (Diff) 6m to the left of the snapper you come to an alcove, climb this on the left side then right at 6m up the crack to the right of “Sharran’s Craic”. Finish as for “Sharran’s Craic”. Sail of the Sentry (VS 4b)** 16m Access the start by scrambling up the first 3m of The Snapper and moving a few metres left, along the grassy ledge, to the shallow ‘sentry box’ in the corner. The climb starts here. Move to the top of the sentry box, reach out and climb right and up onto a narrow ledge. Using the groove on the left, move up easily on good holds to the larger ledge above. Move over right to just left of a diagonal crack (possible long runner) and climb boldly leftwards & up with a delicate move (crux) to finish (escape possible to the left before tackling the crux). The Snapper (VS 4c)*** 25m Immediately in front of the entrance tunnel to De Northside face you will see a large (3m high) triangular block detached from the face, this is the start of the climb. Climb up the block on easy holds and stand on the top, place protection in the flake above and step up, follow the flake left until it peters out. Clamber on to the top (crux) of the flake (subtle move) and reach into the scoop for an excellent hand hold, place protection on your left and move up the slab on crimps and small pockets trending rightwards. Aim for vertical righthand crack above and move up this to finish up over blocky slab to belay point. Sin Binn (E1 5b)** 23m The climb starts 3m to the right of the detached block of the snapper. Start by following the fine vertical crack up to the small ledges, just above head height. Move left by using sidepulls and a high step to the ledge on the small outside corner (crux). Using small holds above continue up the vertical face until better holds appear before gaining the grassy ledge, scramble up over easier ground to the top. Georgie Burgess (VS 4c)* 21m Follow the obvious groove to the bulge. The bulge provides the crux of the route and can be protected by small wires. Tricky moves lead to a high jug which helps you mount the bulge onto the small slab above. Continue up the slab to blockier ground. Me Tarzan, You Insane! (S 4a) 20m PR: M/G A couple of metres to the right of De Northside face entrance is a distinct inset alcove just above head height. Climb straight up the inverted triangular face just to the right of this and make a a delicate push up to gain easier ground. Climb the obvious crack in the short face on your left (great view over the top), scramble across easy ground to the face on the left side and climb the diagonal crack with a delicate move to finish (crux). PR: M/G – Protection is good but for delicate step up near the start of the climb gear is below your feet (or over 1m away on a long runner tucked around the corner in the alcove higher up on the left if you wish). The Budgie Has Landed (S 4a) 22m PR: G Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. Climb goes up left side of the obvious slab, then briefly across vegetated gully and up the obvious alcove on the left at the top. Climb up triangular block (no gear but straightforward) and initially move up right (for a cam placement if you don’t want a long ‘run in’). Strike leftward to follow clear thin diagonal crack running up the left side. Follow this as far as protection/bravery takes you and then cross grassy gully to alcove on the left with a protruding block overhead. Climb up alcove on the right to finish. (Challenge is to stay on the rock and off the grassy gully on your left). The Budgie {Bites Back} (VS 4c) 20 mtrs PR: G° New finish in { } Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top. The Commitment {Direct}** (HS 4b) 20 mtrs PR: G New finish in { } Start on the 2 mtr high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

Climb left side of the slab to a ledge, move up the groove to the right of the arete. The Gabhar (S 4a) 22m Starts on the right side of \"middle yurt\" just to the right of the rhododendron tree growing at the base, climb the obvious gully to the first ledge, then continue up the gully towards the crux where the face steepens before another ledge, from the ledge tend right to the short corner, climb this to top out. ===Northside=== Northside Topo (left end): Three Piece Sweet (S 4a) 30m, 2 pitches PR: M Go to the left of De Northside face past “Sharran’s Craic” for 15m till you come to an 8m high detached pinnacle which has a pointed 1m high rock coming out from the ground at the base of it. 1. (4a) At the left end of the pinnacle is a cave and a tree beside it. Climb up onto the arête and continue to top of pinnacle. Step left onto a ramp which trends up leftwards until you come to a point where you can step up right to climb straight up on the slab to an angled grassy area (thread belay). 2.

From here step onto the pinnacle and up delicately trending left to the left arête and to the top of the pinnacle. PR: P No protection for this section hence HS 4b rating. Captain Planet (VS 4c) 25m Climb the slightly overhanging crack in the pinnacle. Join Three Piece Sweet and follow it until the overhang below the headwall. Arrange gear and climb up the corner. Move diagonally right up the head wall with interest to the top. . Sharran’s Craic (VS 4c) 24m Walk 4m to the left of The Snapper and you will see a vertical crack in the face, this is the start of the climb. The bouldery start is the crux of the climb and you must move up on small flakes and edges above the protection to reach easier holds. Climb the crack above until it finishes and then move left 2 meters into a V shaped short gully and climb this. From the top of the gully trend right over easier ledges following the cleaned rock to a crack, climb the crack and follow the obvious route to the easy finish. Nicky Place (Diff) 6m to the left of the snapper you come to an alcove, climb this on the left side then right at 6m up the crack to the right of “Sharran’s Craic”. Finish as for “Sharran’s Craic”. Sail of the Sentry (VS 4b)** 16m Access the start by scrambling up the first 3m of The Snapper and moving a few metres left, along the grassy ledge, to the shallow ‘sentry box’ in the corner. The climb starts here. Move to the top of the sentry box, reach out and climb right and up onto a narrow ledge. Using the groove on the left, move up easily on good holds to the larger ledge above. Move over right to just left of a diagonal crack (possible long runner) and climb boldly leftwards & up with a delicate move (crux) to finish (escape possible to the left before tackling the crux). The Snapper (VS 4c)*** 25m Immediately in front of the entrance tunnel to De Northside face you will see a large (3m high) triangular block detached from the face, this is the start of the climb. Climb up the block on easy holds and stand on the top, place protection in the flake above and step up, follow the flake left until it peters out. Clamber on to the top (crux) of the flake (subtle move) and reach into the scoop for an excellent hand hold, place protection on your left and move up the slab on crimps and small pockets trending rightwards. Aim for vertical righthand crack above and move up this to finish up over blocky slab to belay point. Sin Binn (E1 5b)** 23m The climb starts 3m to the right of the detached block of the snapper. Start by following the fine vertical crack up to the small ledges, just above head height. Move left by using sidepulls and a high step to the ledge on the small outside corner (crux). Using small holds above continue up the vertical face until better holds appear before gaining the grassy ledge, scramble up over easier ground to the top. Georgie Burgess (VS 4c)* 21m Follow the obvious groove to the bulge. The bulge provides the crux of the route and can be protected by small wires. Tricky moves lead to a high jug which helps you mount the bulge onto the small slab above. Continue up the slab to blockier ground. Me Tarzan, You Insane! (S 4a) 20m PR: M/G A couple of metres to the right of De Northside face entrance is a distinct inset alcove just above head height. Climb straight up the inverted triangular face just to the right of this and make a a delicate push up to gain easier ground. Climb the obvious crack in the short face on your left (great view over the top), scramble across easy ground to the face on the left side and climb the diagonal crack with a delicate move to finish (crux). PR: M/G – Protection is good but for delicate step up near the start of the climb gear is below your feet (or over 1m away on a long runner tucked around the corner in the alcove higher up on the left if you wish). The Budgie Has Landed (S 4a) 22m PR: G Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. Climb goes up left side of the obvious slab, then briefly across vegetated gully and up the obvious alcove on the left at the top. Climb up triangular block (no gear but straightforward) and initially move up right (for a cam placement if you don’t want a long ‘run in’). Strike leftward to follow clear thin diagonal crack running up the left side. Follow this as far as protection/bravery takes you and then cross grassy gully to alcove on the left with a protruding block overhead. Climb up alcove on the right to finish. (Challenge is to stay on the rock and off the grassy gully on your left). The Budgie {Bites Back} (VS 4c) 20 mtrs PR: G° New finish in { } Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top. The Commitment {Direct}** (HS 4b) 20 mtrs PR: G New finish in { } Start on the 2 mtr high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

(4a) At the left end of the pinnacle is a cave and a tree beside it. Climb up onto the arête and continue to top of pinnacle. Step left onto a ramp which trends up leftwards until you come to a point where you can step up right to climb straight up on the slab to an angled grassy area (thread belay). 2. (3c) Move right to cross underneath the roof above and then climb up the crack on the right of it to the top. Variation The Sofa Start (HS 4b) PR: P Start at the right side of the base of the pinnacle and step onto the detached rock. From here step onto the pinnacle and up delicately trending left to the left arête and to the top of the pinnacle. PR: P No protection for this section hence HS 4b rating. Captain Planet (VS 4c) 25m Climb the slightly overhanging crack in the pinnacle. Join Three Piece Sweet and follow it until the overhang below the headwall. Arrange gear and climb up the corner. Move diagonally right up the head wall with interest to the top. . Sharran’s Craic (VS 4c) 24m Walk 4m to the left of The Snapper and you will see a vertical crack in the face, this is the start of the climb. The bouldery start is the crux of the climb and you must move up on small flakes and edges above the protection to reach easier holds. Climb the crack above until it finishes and then move left 2 meters into a V shaped short gully and climb this. From the top of the gully trend right over easier ledges following the cleaned rock to a crack, climb the crack and follow the obvious route to the easy finish. Nicky Place (Diff) 6m to the left of the snapper you come to an alcove, climb this on the left side then right at 6m up the crack to the right of “Sharran’s Craic”. Finish as for “Sharran’s Craic”. Sail of the Sentry (VS 4b)** 16m Access the start by scrambling up the first 3m of The Snapper and moving a few metres left, along the grassy ledge, to the shallow ‘sentry box’ in the corner. The climb starts here. Move to the top of the sentry box, reach out and climb right and up onto a narrow ledge. Using the groove on the left, move up easily on good holds to the larger ledge above. Move over right to just left of a diagonal crack (possible long runner) and climb boldly leftwards & up with a delicate move (crux) to finish (escape possible to the left before tackling the crux). The Snapper (VS 4c)*** 25m Immediately in front of the entrance tunnel to De Northside face you will see a large (3m high) triangular block detached from the face, this is the start of the climb. Climb up the block on easy holds and stand on the top, place protection in the flake above and step up, follow the flake left until it peters out. Clamber on to the top (crux) of the flake (subtle move) and reach into the scoop for an excellent hand hold, place protection on your left and move up the slab on crimps and small pockets trending rightwards. Aim for vertical righthand crack above and move up this to finish up over blocky slab to belay point. Sin Binn (E1 5b)** 23m The climb starts 3m to the right of the detached block of the snapper. Start by following the fine vertical crack up to the small ledges, just above head height. Move left by using sidepulls and a high step to the ledge on the small outside corner (crux). Using small holds above continue up the vertical face until better holds appear before gaining the grassy ledge, scramble up over easier ground to the top. Georgie Burgess (VS 4c)* 21m Follow the obvious groove to the bulge. The bulge provides the crux of the route and can be protected by small wires. Tricky moves lead to a high jug which helps you mount the bulge onto the small slab above. Continue up the slab to blockier ground. Me Tarzan, You Insane! (S 4a) 20m PR: M/G A couple of metres to the right of De Northside face entrance is a distinct inset alcove just above head height. Climb straight up the inverted triangular face just to the right of this and make a a delicate push up to gain easier ground. Climb the obvious crack in the short face on your left (great view over the top), scramble across easy ground to the face on the left side and climb the diagonal crack with a delicate move to finish (crux). PR: M/G – Protection is good but for delicate step up near the start of the climb gear is below your feet (or over 1m away on a long runner tucked around the corner in the alcove higher up on the left if you wish). The Budgie Has Landed (S 4a) 22m PR: G Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. Climb goes up left side of the obvious slab, then briefly across vegetated gully and up the obvious alcove on the left at the top. Climb up triangular block (no gear but straightforward) and initially move up right (for a cam placement if you don’t want a long ‘run in’). Strike leftward to follow clear thin diagonal crack running up the left side. Follow this as far as protection/bravery takes you and then cross grassy gully to alcove on the left with a protruding block overhead. Climb up alcove on the right to finish. (Challenge is to stay on the rock and off the grassy gully on your left). The Budgie {Bites Back} (VS 4c) 20 mtrs PR: G° New finish in { } Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top. The Commitment {Direct}** (HS 4b) 20 mtrs PR: G New finish in { } Start on the 2 mtr high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

(4a) At the left end of the pinnacle is a cave and a tree beside it. Climb up onto the arête and continue to top of pinnacle. Step left onto a ramp which trends up leftwards until you come to a point where you can step up right to climb straight up on the slab to an angled grassy area (thread belay). 2. (3c) Move right to cross underneath the roof above and then climb up the crack on the right of it to the top. Variation The Sofa Start (HS 4b) PR: P Start at the right side of the base of the pinnacle and step onto the detached rock. From here step onto the pinnacle and up delicately trending left to the left arête and to the top of the pinnacle. PR: P No protection for this section hence HS 4b rating. Captain Planet (VS 4c) 25m Climb the slightly overhanging crack in the pinnacle. Join Three Piece Sweet and follow it until the overhang below the headwall. Arrange gear and climb up the corner. Move diagonally right up the head wall with interest to the top. . Sharran’s Craic (VS 4c) 24m Walk 4m to the left of The Snapper and you will see a vertical crack in the face, this is the start of the climb. The bouldery start is the crux of the climb and you must move up on small flakes and edges above the protection to reach easier holds. Climb the crack above until it finishes and then move left 2 meters into a V shaped short gully and climb this. From the top of the gully trend right over easier ledges following the cleaned rock to a crack, climb the crack and follow the obvious route to the easy finish. Nicky Place (Diff) 6m to the left of the snapper you come to an alcove, climb this on the left side then right at 6m up the crack to the right of “Sharran’s Craic”. Finish as for “Sharran’s Craic”. Sail of the Sentry (VS 4b)** 16m Access the start by scrambling up the first 3m of The Snapper and moving a few metres left, along the grassy ledge, to the shallow ‘sentry box’ in the corner. The climb starts here. Move to the top of the sentry box, reach out and climb right and up onto a narrow ledge. Using the groove on the left, move up easily on good holds to the larger ledge above. Move over right to just left of a diagonal crack (possible long runner) and climb boldly leftwards & up with a delicate move (crux) to finish (escape possible to the left before tackling the crux). The Snapper (VS 4c)*** 25m Immediately in front of the entrance tunnel to De Northside face you will see a large (3m high) triangular block detached from the face, this is the start of the climb. Climb up the block on easy holds and stand on the top, place protection in the flake above and step up, follow the flake left until it peters out. Clamber on to the top (crux) of the flake (subtle move) and reach into the scoop for an excellent hand hold, place protection on your left and move up the slab on crimps and small pockets trending rightwards. Aim for vertical righthand crack above and move up this to finish up over blocky slab to belay point. Sin Binn (E1 5b)** 23m The climb starts 3m to the right of the detached block of the snapper. Start by following the fine vertical crack up to the small ledges, just above head height. Move left by using sidepulls and a high step to the ledge on the small outside corner (crux). Using small holds above continue up the vertical face until better holds appear before gaining the grassy ledge, scramble up over easier ground to the top. Georgie Burgess (VS 4c)* 21m Follow the obvious groove to the bulge. The bulge provides the crux of the route and can be protected by small wires. Tricky moves lead to a high jug which helps you mount the bulge onto the small slab above. Continue up the slab to blockier ground. Me Tarzan, You Insane! (S 4a) 20m PR: M/G A couple of metres to the right of De Northside face entrance is a distinct inset alcove just above head height. Climb straight up the inverted triangular face just to the right of this and make a a delicate push up to gain easier ground. Climb the obvious crack in the short face on your left (great view over the top), scramble across easy ground to the face on the left side and climb the diagonal crack with a delicate move to finish (crux). PR: M/G – Protection is good but for delicate step up near the start of the climb gear is below your feet (or over 1m away on a long runner tucked around the corner in the alcove higher up on the left if you wish). The Budgie Has Landed (S 4a) 22m PR: G Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. Climb goes up left side of the obvious slab, then briefly across vegetated gully and up the obvious alcove on the left at the top. Climb up triangular block (no gear but straightforward) and initially move up right (for a cam placement if you don’t want a long ‘run in’). Strike leftward to follow clear thin diagonal crack running up the left side. Follow this as far as protection/bravery takes you and then cross grassy gully to alcove on the left with a protruding block overhead. Climb up alcove on the right to finish. (Challenge is to stay on the rock and off the grassy gully on your left). The Budgie {Bites Back} (VS 4c) 20 mtrs PR: G° New finish in { } Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top. The Commitment {Direct}** (HS 4b) 20 mtrs PR: G New finish in { } Start on the 2 mtr high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

From here step onto the pinnacle and up delicately trending left to the left arête and to the top of the pinnacle. PR: P No protection for this section hence HS 4b rating. Captain Planet (VS 4c) 25m Climb the slightly overhanging crack in the pinnacle. Join Three Piece Sweet and follow it until the overhang below the headwall. Arrange gear and climb up the corner. Move diagonally right up the head wall with interest to the top. . Sharran’s Craic (VS 4c) 24m Walk 4m to the left of The Snapper and you will see a vertical crack in the face, this is the start of the climb. The bouldery start is the crux of the climb and you must move up on small flakes and edges above the protection to reach easier holds. Climb the crack above until it finishes and then move left 2 meters into a V shaped short gully and climb this. From the top of the gully trend right over easier ledges following the cleaned rock to a crack, climb the crack and follow the obvious route to the easy finish. Nicky Place (Diff) 6m to the left of the snapper you come to an alcove, climb this on the left side then right at 6m up the crack to the right of “Sharran’s Craic”. Finish as for “Sharran’s Craic”. Sail of the Sentry (VS 4b)** 16m Access the start by scrambling up the first 3m of The Snapper and moving a few metres left, along the grassy ledge, to the shallow ‘sentry box’ in the corner. The climb starts here. Move to the top of the sentry box, reach out and climb right and up onto a narrow ledge. Using the groove on the left, move up easily on good holds to the larger ledge above. Move over right to just left of a diagonal crack (possible long runner) and climb boldly leftwards & up with a delicate move (crux) to finish (escape possible to the left before tackling the crux). The Snapper (VS 4c)*** 25m Immediately in front of the entrance tunnel to De Northside face you will see a large (3m high) triangular block detached from the face, this is the start of the climb. Climb up the block on easy holds and stand on the top, place protection in the flake above and step up, follow the flake left until it peters out. Clamber on to the top (crux) of the flake (subtle move) and reach into the scoop for an excellent hand hold, place protection on your left and move up the slab on crimps and small pockets trending rightwards. Aim for vertical righthand crack above and move up this to finish up over blocky slab to belay point. Sin Binn (E1 5b)** 23m The climb starts 3m to the right of the detached block of the snapper. Start by following the fine vertical crack up to the small ledges, just above head height. Move left by using sidepulls and a high step to the ledge on the small outside corner (crux). Using small holds above continue up the vertical face until better holds appear before gaining the grassy ledge, scramble up over easier ground to the top. Georgie Burgess (VS 4c)* 21m Follow the obvious groove to the bulge. The bulge provides the crux of the route and can be protected by small wires. Tricky moves lead to a high jug which helps you mount the bulge onto the small slab above. Continue up the slab to blockier ground. Me Tarzan, You Insane! (S 4a) 20m PR: M/G A couple of metres to the right of De Northside face entrance is a distinct inset alcove just above head height. Climb straight up the inverted triangular face just to the right of this and make a a delicate push up to gain easier ground. Climb the obvious crack in the short face on your left (great view over the top), scramble across easy ground to the face on the left side and climb the diagonal crack with a delicate move to finish (crux). PR: M/G – Protection is good but for delicate step up near the start of the climb gear is below your feet (or over 1m away on a long runner tucked around the corner in the alcove higher up on the left if you wish). The Budgie Has Landed (S 4a) 22m PR: G Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. Climb goes up left side of the obvious slab, then briefly across vegetated gully and up the obvious alcove on the left at the top. Climb up triangular block (no gear but straightforward) and initially move up right (for a cam placement if you don’t want a long ‘run in’). Strike leftward to follow clear thin diagonal crack running up the left side. Follow this as far as protection/bravery takes you and then cross grassy gully to alcove on the left with a protruding block overhead. Climb up alcove on the right to finish.

Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right.

Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

From here step onto the pinnacle and up delicately trending left to the left arête and to the top of the pinnacle. PR: P No protection for this section hence HS 4b rating. Captain Planet (VS 4c) 25m Climb the slightly overhanging crack in the pinnacle. Join Three Piece Sweet and follow it until the overhang below the headwall. Arrange gear and climb up the corner. Move diagonally right up the head wall with interest to the top. . Sharran’s Craic (VS 4c) 24m Walk 4m to the left of The Snapper and you will see a vertical crack in the face, this is the start of the climb. The bouldery start is the crux of the climb and you must move up on small flakes and edges above the protection to reach easier holds. Climb the crack above until it finishes and then move left 2 meters into a V shaped short gully and climb this. From the top of the gully trend right over easier ledges following the cleaned rock to a crack, climb the crack and follow the obvious route to the easy finish. Nicky Place (Diff) 6m to the left of the snapper you come to an alcove, climb this on the left side then right at 6m up the crack to the right of “Sharran’s Craic”. Finish as for “Sharran’s Craic”. Sail of the Sentry (VS 4b)** 16m Access the start by scrambling up the first 3m of The Snapper and moving a few metres left, along the grassy ledge, to the shallow ‘sentry box’ in the corner. The climb starts here. Move to the top of the sentry box, reach out and climb right and up onto a narrow ledge. Using the groove on the left, move up easily on good holds to the larger ledge above. Move over right to just left of a diagonal crack (possible long runner) and climb boldly leftwards & up with a delicate move (crux) to finish (escape possible to the left before tackling the crux). The Snapper (VS 4c)*** 25m Immediately in front of the entrance tunnel to De Northside face you will see a large (3m high) triangular block detached from the face, this is the start of the climb. Climb up the block on easy holds and stand on the top, place protection in the flake above and step up, follow the flake left until it peters out. Clamber on to the top (crux) of the flake (subtle move) and reach into the scoop for an excellent hand hold, place protection on your left and move up the slab on crimps and small pockets trending rightwards. Aim for vertical righthand crack above and move up this to finish up over blocky slab to belay point. Sin Binn (E1 5b)** 23m The climb starts 3m to the right of the detached block of the snapper. Start by following the fine vertical crack up to the small ledges, just above head height. Move left by using sidepulls and a high step to the ledge on the small outside corner (crux). Using small holds above continue up the vertical face until better holds appear before gaining the grassy ledge, scramble up over easier ground to the top. Georgie Burgess (VS 4c)* 21m Follow the obvious groove to the bulge. The bulge provides the crux of the route and can be protected by small wires. Tricky moves lead to a high jug which helps you mount the bulge onto the small slab above. Continue up the slab to blockier ground. Me Tarzan, You Insane! (S 4a) 20m PR: M/G A couple of metres to the right of De Northside face entrance is a distinct inset alcove just above head height. Climb straight up the inverted triangular face just to the right of this and make a a delicate push up to gain easier ground. Climb the obvious crack in the short face on your left (great view over the top), scramble across easy ground to the face on the left side and climb the diagonal crack with a delicate move to finish (crux). PR: M/G – Protection is good but for delicate step up near the start of the climb gear is below your feet (or over 1m away on a long runner tucked around the corner in the alcove higher up on the left if you wish). The Budgie Has Landed (S 4a) 22m PR: G Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. Climb goes up left side of the obvious slab, then briefly across vegetated gully and up the obvious alcove on the left at the top. Climb up triangular block (no gear but straightforward) and initially move up right (for a cam placement if you don’t want a long ‘run in’). Strike leftward to follow clear thin diagonal crack running up the left side. Follow this as far as protection/bravery takes you and then cross grassy gully to alcove on the left with a protruding block overhead. Climb up alcove on the right to finish. (Challenge is to stay on the rock and off the grassy gully on your left). The Budgie {Bites Back} (VS 4c) 20 mtrs PR: G° New finish in { } Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top. The Commitment {Direct}** (HS 4b) 20 mtrs PR: G New finish in { } Start on the 2 mtr high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

Arrange gear and climb up the corner. Move diagonally right up the head wall with interest to the top. . Sharran’s Craic (VS 4c) 24m Walk 4m to the left of The Snapper and you will see a vertical crack in the face, this is the start of the climb. The bouldery start is the crux of the climb and you must move up on small flakes and edges above the protection to reach easier holds. Climb the crack above until it finishes and then move left 2 meters into a V shaped short gully and climb this. From the top of the gully trend right over easier ledges following the cleaned rock to a crack, climb the crack and follow the obvious route to the easy finish. Nicky Place (Diff) 6m to the left of the snapper you come to an alcove, climb this on the left side then right at 6m up the crack to the right of “Sharran’s Craic”. Finish as for “Sharran’s Craic”. Sail of the Sentry (VS 4b)** 16m Access the start by scrambling up the first 3m of The Snapper and moving a few metres left, along the grassy ledge, to the shallow ‘sentry box’ in the corner. The climb starts here. Move to the top of the sentry box, reach out and climb right and up onto a narrow ledge. Using the groove on the left, move up easily on good holds to the larger ledge above. Move over right to just left of a diagonal crack (possible long runner) and climb boldly leftwards & up with a delicate move (crux) to finish (escape possible to the left before tackling the crux). The Snapper (VS 4c)*** 25m Immediately in front of the entrance tunnel to De Northside face you will see a large (3m high) triangular block detached from the face, this is the start of the climb. Climb up the block on easy holds and stand on the top, place protection in the flake above and step up, follow the flake left until it peters out. Clamber on to the top (crux) of the flake (subtle move) and reach into the scoop for an excellent hand hold, place protection on your left and move up the slab on crimps and small pockets trending rightwards. Aim for vertical righthand crack above and move up this to finish up over blocky slab to belay point. Sin Binn (E1 5b)** 23m The climb starts 3m to the right of the detached block of the snapper. Start by following the fine vertical crack up to the small ledges, just above head height. Move left by using sidepulls and a high step to the ledge on the small outside corner (crux). Using small holds above continue up the vertical face until better holds appear before gaining the grassy ledge, scramble up over easier ground to the top. Georgie Burgess (VS 4c)* 21m Follow the obvious groove to the bulge. The bulge provides the crux of the route and can be protected by small wires. Tricky moves lead to a high jug which helps you mount the bulge onto the small slab above. Continue up the slab to blockier ground. Me Tarzan, You Insane! (S 4a) 20m PR: M/G A couple of metres to the right of De Northside face entrance is a distinct inset alcove just above head height. Climb straight up the inverted triangular face just to the right of this and make a a delicate push up to gain easier ground. Climb the obvious crack in the short face on your left (great view over the top), scramble across easy ground to the face on the left side and climb the diagonal crack with a delicate move to finish (crux). PR: M/G – Protection is good but for delicate step up near the start of the climb gear is below your feet (or over 1m away on a long runner tucked around the corner in the alcove higher up on the left if you wish). The Budgie Has Landed (S 4a) 22m PR: G Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. Climb goes up left side of the obvious slab, then briefly across vegetated gully and up the obvious alcove on the left at the top. Climb up triangular block (no gear but straightforward) and initially move up right (for a cam placement if you don’t want a long ‘run in’). Strike leftward to follow clear thin diagonal crack running up the left side. Follow this as far as protection/bravery takes you and then cross grassy gully to alcove on the left with a protruding block overhead. Climb up alcove on the right to finish. (Challenge is to stay on the rock and off the grassy gully on your left). The Budgie {Bites Back} (VS 4c) 20 mtrs PR: G° New finish in { } Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top. The Commitment {Direct}** (HS 4b) 20 mtrs PR: G New finish in { } Start on the 2 mtr high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

Move diagonally right up the head wall with interest to the top. . Sharran’s Craic (VS 4c) 24m Walk 4m to the left of The Snapper and you will see a vertical crack in the face, this is the start of the climb. The bouldery start is the crux of the climb and you must move up on small flakes and edges above the protection to reach easier holds. Climb the crack above until it finishes and then move left 2 meters into a V shaped short gully and climb this. From the top of the gully trend right over easier ledges following the cleaned rock to a crack, climb the crack and follow the obvious route to the easy finish. Nicky Place (Diff) 6m to the left of the snapper you come to an alcove, climb this on the left side then right at 6m up the crack to the right of “Sharran’s Craic”. Finish as for “Sharran’s Craic”. Sail of the Sentry (VS 4b)** 16m Access the start by scrambling up the first 3m of The Snapper and moving a few metres left, along the grassy ledge, to the shallow ‘sentry box’ in the corner. The climb starts here. Move to the top of the sentry box, reach out and climb right and up onto a narrow ledge. Using the groove on the left, move up easily on good holds to the larger ledge above. Move over right to just left of a diagonal crack (possible long runner) and climb boldly leftwards & up with a delicate move (crux) to finish (escape possible to the left before tackling the crux). The Snapper (VS 4c)*** 25m Immediately in front of the entrance tunnel to De Northside face you will see a large (3m high) triangular block detached from the face, this is the start of the climb. Climb up the block on easy holds and stand on the top, place protection in the flake above and step up, follow the flake left until it peters out. Clamber on to the top (crux) of the flake (subtle move) and reach into the scoop for an excellent hand hold, place protection on your left and move up the slab on crimps and small pockets trending rightwards. Aim for vertical righthand crack above and move up this to finish up over blocky slab to belay point. Sin Binn (E1 5b)** 23m The climb starts 3m to the right of the detached block of the snapper. Start by following the fine vertical crack up to the small ledges, just above head height. Move left by using sidepulls and a high step to the ledge on the small outside corner (crux). Using small holds above continue up the vertical face until better holds appear before gaining the grassy ledge, scramble up over easier ground to the top. Georgie Burgess (VS 4c)* 21m Follow the obvious groove to the bulge. The bulge provides the crux of the route and can be protected by small wires. Tricky moves lead to a high jug which helps you mount the bulge onto the small slab above. Continue up the slab to blockier ground. Me Tarzan, You Insane! (S 4a) 20m PR: M/G A couple of metres to the right of De Northside face entrance is a distinct inset alcove just above head height. Climb straight up the inverted triangular face just to the right of this and make a a delicate push up to gain easier ground. Climb the obvious crack in the short face on your left (great view over the top), scramble across easy ground to the face on the left side and climb the diagonal crack with a delicate move to finish (crux). PR: M/G – Protection is good but for delicate step up near the start of the climb gear is below your feet (or over 1m away on a long runner tucked around the corner in the alcove higher up on the left if you wish). The Budgie Has Landed (S 4a) 22m PR: G Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. Climb goes up left side of the obvious slab, then briefly across vegetated gully and up the obvious alcove on the left at the top. Climb up triangular block (no gear but straightforward) and initially move up right (for a cam placement if you don’t want a long ‘run in’). Strike leftward to follow clear thin diagonal crack running up the left side. Follow this as far as protection/bravery takes you and then cross grassy gully to alcove on the left with a protruding block overhead. Climb up alcove on the right to finish. (Challenge is to stay on the rock and off the grassy gully on your left). The Budgie {Bites Back} (VS 4c) 20 mtrs PR: G° New finish in { } Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top. The Commitment {Direct}** (HS 4b) 20 mtrs PR: G New finish in { } Start on the 2 mtr high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

            "description": "1. (4a) At the left end of the pinnacle is a cave and a tree beside it. Climb up onto the arête and continue to top of pinnacle. Step left onto a ramp which trends up leftwards until you come to a point where you can step up right to climb straight up on the slab to an angled grassy area (thread belay). 2. (3c) Move right to cross underneath the roof above and then climb up the crack on the right of it to the top. Variation The Sofa Start (HS 4b) PR: P Start at the right side of the base of the pinnacle and step onto the detached rock. From here step onto the pinnacle and up delicately trending left to the left arête and to the top of the pinnacle. PR: P No protection for this section hence HS 4b rating. Captain Planet (VS 4c) 25m Climb the slightly overhanging crack in the pinnacle. Join Three Piece Sweet and follow it until the overhang below the headwall. Arrange gear and climb up the corner. Move diagonally right up the head wall with interest to the top. . Sharran’s Craic (VS 4c) 24m Walk 4m to the left of The Snapper and you will see a vertical crack in the face, this is the start of the climb. The bouldery start is the crux of the climb and you must move up on small flakes and edges above the protection to reach easier holds. Climb the crack above until it finishes and then move left 2 meters into a V shaped short gully and climb this. From the top of the gully trend right over easier ledges following the cleaned rock to a crack, climb the crack and follow the obvious route to the easy finish. Nicky Place (Diff) 6m to the left of the snapper you come to an alcove, climb this on the left side then right at 6m up the crack to the right of “Sharran’s Craic”. Finish as for “Sharran’s Craic”. Sail of the Sentry (VS 4b)** 16m Access the start by scrambling up the first 3m of The Snapper and moving a few metres left, along the grassy ledge, to the shallow ‘sentry box’ in the corner. The climb starts here. Move to the top of the sentry box, reach out and climb right and up onto a narrow ledge. Using the groove on the left, move up easily on good holds to the larger ledge above. Move over right to just left of a diagonal crack (possible long runner) and climb boldly leftwards & up with a delicate move (crux) to finish (escape possible to the left before tackling the crux). The Snapper (VS 4c)*** 25m Immediately in front of the entrance tunnel to De Northside face you will see a large (3m high) triangular block detached from the face, this is the start of the climb. Climb up the block on easy holds and stand on the top, place protection in the flake above and step up, follow the flake left until it peters out. Clamber on to the top (crux) of the flake (subtle move) and reach into the scoop for an excellent hand hold, place protection on your left and move up the slab on crimps and small pockets trending rightwards. Aim for vertical righthand crack above and move up this to finish up over blocky slab to belay point. Sin Binn (E1 5b)** 23m The climb starts 3m to the right of the detached block of the snapper. Start by following the fine vertical crack up to the small ledges, just above head height. Move left by using sidepulls and a high step to the ledge on the small outside corner (crux). Using small holds above continue up the vertical face until better holds appear before gaining the grassy ledge, scramble up over easier ground to the top. Georgie Burgess (VS 4c)* 21m Follow the obvious groove to the bulge. The bulge provides the crux of the route and can be protected by small wires. Tricky moves lead to a high jug which helps you mount the bulge onto the small slab above. Continue up the slab to blockier ground. Me Tarzan, You Insane! (S 4a) 20m PR: M/G A couple of metres to the right of De Northside face entrance is a distinct inset alcove just above head height. Climb straight up the inverted triangular face just to the right of this and make a a delicate push up to gain easier ground. Climb the obvious crack in the short face on your left (great view over the top), scramble across easy ground to the face on the left side and climb the diagonal crack with a delicate move to finish (crux). PR: M/G – Protection is good but for delicate step up near the start of the climb gear is below your feet (or over 1m away on a long runner tucked around the corner in the alcove higher up on the left if you wish). The Budgie Has Landed (S 4a) 22m PR: G Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. Climb goes up left side of the obvious slab, then briefly across vegetated gully and up the obvious alcove on the left at the top. Climb up triangular block (no gear but straightforward) and initially move up right (for a cam placement if you don’t want a long ‘run in’). Strike leftward to follow clear thin diagonal crack running up the left side. Follow this as far as protection/bravery takes you and then cross grassy gully to alcove on the left with a protruding block overhead. Climb up alcove on the right to finish. (Challenge is to stay on the rock and off the grassy gully on your left). The Budgie {Bites Back} (VS 4c) 20 mtrs PR: G° New finish in { } Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top. The Commitment {Direct}** (HS 4b) 20 mtrs PR: G New finish in { } Start on the 2 mtr high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

Finish as for “Sharran’s Craic”. Sail of the Sentry (VS 4b)** 16m Access the start by scrambling up the first 3m of The Snapper and moving a few metres left, along the grassy ledge, to the shallow ‘sentry box’ in the corner. The climb starts here. Move to the top of the sentry box, reach out and climb right and up onto a narrow ledge. Using the groove on the left, move up easily on good holds to the larger ledge above. Move over right to just left of a diagonal crack (possible long runner) and climb boldly leftwards & up with a delicate move (crux) to finish (escape possible to the left before tackling the crux).

Clamber on to the top (crux) of the flake (subtle move) and reach into the scoop for an excellent hand hold, place protection on your left and move up the slab on crimps and small pockets trending rightwards. Aim for vertical righthand crack above and move up this to finish up over blocky slab to belay point. Sin Binn (E1 5b)** 23m The climb starts 3m to the right of the detached block of the snapper. Start by following the fine vertical crack up to the small ledges, just above head height. Move left by using sidepulls and a high step to the ledge on the small outside corner (crux). Using small holds above continue up the vertical face until better holds appear before gaining the grassy ledge, scramble up over easier ground to the top. Georgie Burgess (VS 4c)* 21m Follow the obvious groove to the bulge. The bulge provides the crux of the route and can be protected by small wires. Tricky moves lead to a high jug which helps you mount the bulge onto the small slab above. Continue up the slab to blockier ground. Me Tarzan, You Insane! (S 4a) 20m PR: M/G A couple of metres to the right of De Northside face entrance is a distinct inset alcove just above head height. Climb straight up the inverted triangular face just to the right of this and make a a delicate push up to gain easier ground. Climb the obvious crack in the short face on your left (great view over the top), scramble across easy ground to the face on the left side and climb the diagonal crack with a delicate move to finish (crux). PR: M/G – Protection is good but for delicate step up near the start of the climb gear is below your feet (or over 1m away on a long runner tucked around the corner in the alcove higher up on the left if you wish). The Budgie Has Landed (S 4a) 22m PR: G Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. Climb goes up left side of the obvious slab, then briefly across vegetated gully and up the obvious alcove on the left at the top. Climb up triangular block (no gear but straightforward) and initially move up right (for a cam placement if you don’t want a long ‘run in’). Strike leftward to follow clear thin diagonal crack running up the left side. Follow this as far as protection/bravery takes you and then cross grassy gully to alcove on the left with a protruding block overhead. Climb up alcove on the right to finish. (Challenge is to stay on the rock and off the grassy gully on your left). The Budgie {Bites Back} (VS 4c) 20 mtrs PR: G° New finish in { } Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top. The Commitment {Direct}** (HS 4b) 20 mtrs PR: G New finish in { } Start on the 2 mtr high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

The climb starts here. Move to the top of the sentry box, reach out and climb right and up onto a narrow ledge. Using the groove on the left, move up easily on good holds to the larger ledge above. Move over right to just left of a diagonal crack (possible long runner) and climb boldly leftwards & up with a delicate move (crux) to finish (escape possible to the left before tackling the crux). The Snapper (VS 4c)*** 25m Immediately in front of the entrance tunnel to De Northside face you will see a large (3m high) triangular block detached from the face, this is the start of the climb. Climb up the block on easy holds and stand on the top, place protection in the flake above and step up, follow the flake left until it peters out. Clamber on to the top (crux) of the flake (subtle move) and reach into the scoop for an excellent hand hold, place protection on your left and move up the slab on crimps and small pockets trending rightwards. Aim for vertical righthand crack above and move up this to finish up over blocky slab to belay point. Sin Binn (E1 5b)** 23m The climb starts 3m to the right of the detached block of the snapper. Start by following the fine vertical crack up to the small ledges, just above head height. Move left by using sidepulls and a high step to the ledge on the small outside corner (crux). Using small holds above continue up the vertical face until better holds appear before gaining the grassy ledge, scramble up over easier ground to the top. Georgie Burgess (VS 4c)* 21m Follow the obvious groove to the bulge. The bulge provides the crux of the route and can be protected by small wires.

Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point.

Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

Finish as for “Sharran’s Craic”. Sail of the Sentry (VS 4b)** 16m Access the start by scrambling up the first 3m of The Snapper and moving a few metres left, along the grassy ledge, to the shallow ‘sentry box’ in the corner. The climb starts here. Move to the top of the sentry box, reach out and climb right and up onto a narrow ledge. Using the groove on the left, move up easily on good holds to the larger ledge above. Move over right to just left of a diagonal crack (possible long runner) and climb boldly leftwards & up with a delicate move (crux) to finish (escape possible to the left before tackling the crux). The Snapper (VS 4c)*** 25m Immediately in front of the entrance tunnel to De Northside face you will see a large (3m high) triangular block detached from the face, this is the start of the climb. Climb up the block on easy holds and stand on the top, place protection in the flake above and step up, follow the flake left until it peters out. Clamber on to the top (crux) of the flake (subtle move) and reach into the scoop for an excellent hand hold, place protection on your left and move up the slab on crimps and small pockets trending rightwards. Aim for vertical righthand crack above and move up this to finish up over blocky slab to belay point. Sin Binn (E1 5b)** 23m The climb starts 3m to the right of the detached block of the snapper. Start by following the fine vertical crack up to the small ledges, just above head height. Move left by using sidepulls and a high step to the ledge on the small outside corner (crux). Using small holds above continue up the vertical face until better holds appear before gaining the grassy ledge, scramble up over easier ground to the top. Georgie Burgess (VS 4c)* 21m Follow the obvious groove to the bulge. The bulge provides the crux of the route and can be protected by small wires. Tricky moves lead to a high jug which helps you mount the bulge onto the small slab above. Continue up the slab to blockier ground. Me Tarzan, You Insane! (S 4a) 20m PR: M/G A couple of metres to the right of De Northside face entrance is a distinct inset alcove just above head height. Climb straight up the inverted triangular face just to the right of this and make a a delicate push up to gain easier ground. Climb the obvious crack in the short face on your left (great view over the top), scramble across easy ground to the face on the left side and climb the diagonal crack with a delicate move to finish (crux). PR: M/G – Protection is good but for delicate step up near the start of the climb gear is below your feet (or over 1m away on a long runner tucked around the corner in the alcove higher up on the left if you wish). The Budgie Has Landed (S 4a) 22m PR: G Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. Climb goes up left side of the obvious slab, then briefly across vegetated gully and up the obvious alcove on the left at the top. Climb up triangular block (no gear but straightforward) and initially move up right (for a cam placement if you don’t want a long ‘run in’). Strike leftward to follow clear thin diagonal crack running up the left side. Follow this as far as protection/bravery takes you and then cross grassy gully to alcove on the left with a protruding block overhead. Climb up alcove on the right to finish. (Challenge is to stay on the rock and off the grassy gully on your left). The Budgie {Bites Back} (VS 4c) 20 mtrs PR: G° New finish in { } Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top.

Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

Move left by using sidepulls and a high step to the ledge on the small outside corner (crux). Using small holds above continue up the vertical face until better holds appear before gaining the grassy ledge, scramble up over easier ground to the top. Georgie Burgess (VS 4c)* 21m Follow the obvious groove to the bulge. The bulge provides the crux of the route and can be protected by small wires. Tricky moves lead to a high jug which helps you mount the bulge onto the small slab above. Continue up the slab to blockier ground. Me Tarzan, You Insane! (S 4a) 20m PR: M/G A couple of metres to the right of De Northside face entrance is a distinct inset alcove just above head height. Climb straight up the inverted triangular face just to the right of this and make a a delicate push up to gain easier ground. Climb the obvious crack in the short face on your left (great view over the top), scramble across easy ground to the face on the left side and climb the diagonal crack with a delicate move to finish (crux). PR: M/G – Protection is good but for delicate step up near the start of the climb gear is below your feet (or over 1m away on a long runner tucked around the corner in the alcove higher up on the left if you wish). The Budgie Has Landed (S 4a) 22m PR: G Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. Climb goes up left side of the obvious slab, then briefly across vegetated gully and up the obvious alcove on the left at the top. Climb up triangular block (no gear but straightforward) and initially move up right (for a cam placement if you don’t want a long ‘run in’). Strike leftward to follow clear thin diagonal crack running up the left side. Follow this as far as protection/bravery takes you and then cross grassy gully to alcove on the left with a protruding block overhead. Climb up alcove on the right to finish. (Challenge is to stay on the rock and off the grassy gully on your left). The Budgie {Bites Back} (VS 4c) 20 mtrs PR: G° New finish in { } Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top. The Commitment {Direct}** (HS 4b) 20 mtrs PR: G New finish in { } Start on the 2 mtr high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower.

When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

(S 4a) 20m PR: M/G A couple of metres to the right of De Northside face entrance is a distinct inset alcove just above head height. Climb straight up the inverted triangular face just to the right of this and make a a delicate push up to gain easier ground. Climb the obvious crack in the short face on your left (great view over the top), scramble across easy ground to the face on the left side and climb the diagonal crack with a delicate move to finish (crux). PR: M/G – Protection is good but for delicate step up near the start of the climb gear is below your feet (or over 1m away on a long runner tucked around the corner in the alcove higher up on the left if you wish). The Budgie Has Landed (S 4a) 22m PR: G Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. Climb goes up left side of the obvious slab, then briefly across vegetated gully and up the obvious alcove on the left at the top. Climb up triangular block (no gear but straightforward) and initially move up right (for a cam placement if you don’t want a long ‘run in’). Strike leftward to follow clear thin diagonal crack running up the left side. Follow this as far as protection/bravery takes you and then cross grassy gully to alcove on the left with a protruding block overhead. Climb up alcove on the right to finish. (Challenge is to stay on the rock and off the grassy gully on your left). The Budgie {Bites Back} (VS 4c) 20 mtrs PR: G° New finish in { } Start 4m to the right of MTYI (as for The Commitment) and just to the right of a narrow vegetated area. The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top. The Commitment {Direct}** (HS 4b) 20 mtrs PR: G New finish in { } Start on the 2 mtr high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb.

Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole.

Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection.

Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes.

Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top.

Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE).

Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile.

Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected.

The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

The climb goes up the left side of the slab and straight up the left side of the vertical wall above (the challenge being to stay completely off the vegetated gully to the left and on the rock at all times). {At the top of the slab a few delicate moves (protected by 2 small offset nuts in the obvious small crack running up the left side of the wall) gets you up onto a higher tier (crux). Climb straight up this on the left side briefly (to a cam placement tucked around the side half way up) and then step over rightward to finish out through the top of the Commitment Direct (see following climb).}. The Commitment (VS 4b) 22m Start on the 2m high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation and loose rock by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully exiting on the right. Move carefully rightward over loose rock and place a good cam in the horizontal crack at ankle level and climb the arête confidently with small holds to the top. The Commitment {Direct}** (HS 4b) 20 mtrs PR: G New finish in { } Start on the 2 mtr high boulder in front of the slab approx 4 mtrs to the right of Me Tarzan, you will see a vegetated gully to the left and a vertical slab and then a V shaped rock gully (sometimes called a Diedre). Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route.

Climb directly to this avoiding the vegetation by staying to the left on clean rock. Place protection and bridge up the gully (crux). {At the top move left to the base of the clean vertical wall on the left. There is a diagonal crack running up this which can be well protected with cams. Climb this to the top.}. Damn You Newton (VS 4c)* 23m PR: G Start is 3m to the right of TBHL and 2m back from the right hand edge of De Northside face. The climb goes up an obvious large leg jamb sized crack which requires a big hex/cam. Climb this with strong moves to gain a foothold to push up to the top of the crack (crux).Trend right past the overhang and move into De Alcove area. Cross this and head for the middle of the slab straight ahead (a little down from the rhododendron stumps). Make a delicate step up right at the obvious lower point. Move up briefly straight (protection placements) and then trend right for the small block on the skyline on your right and finish left around this. Indian Summer (S 4a)** 24m PR: G Ian Christie, Colm Peppard – 27 Sept 14 At the right hand end of De Northside face immediately past Damn You Newton there is a wide crack on the right side of the slab leading to a small ledge at 2m. Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

Surmount this and move up a crack above to an angled grassy bank at 6m to enter De Alcove. Move straight across De Alcove and straight up to the right of the rhododendron stumps following the obvious crack on up to the top. ===Southside=== Southside Topo: Deer Park Topo (right) - De Southside [click to enlarge] Deer Park Southside Topo (different angle) Eva Lution (HS 4a)* 29mPR: M Ian Christie, Colm Peppard, Kevin Coakley – 25 Sept 14 Just before the track junction going up to De Southside face there is a prominent outcrop of rock about 3m high. Climb this (bouldering start) and continue up over boulders to a right trending crack. Up this to a prominent nose (~10m). Go right of this then immediately back left and up a left trending ramp then straight up to the top. Ali Baba (MS 4a)*** 29m PR: G Ian Christie, Kevin Coakley – May 15 Climb “Eva Lution” but at the top of the right trending crack stay right onto the arête and then keep right on the arête until you can step out on to the main face. Continue up this to the top. We Do This For Fun? (HVS 5a)*** 17m PR: G (cams required) Climb goes through the clear gap on the left side of the large blocky overhang. Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide.

Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge.

Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected.

Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

Start is 4m up from the path junction on the left through the 2nd narrow opening where there is a clear rock ramp. Follow the obvious crack moving diagonally right to gain the shelf below the gap in the overhang. Climb straight up just left of the gap to under the overhang (and get a cam in!). Make a brave pull up to seek out a good hold over the top for the fully committed swing across right to gain a foothold to surmount the overhang (crux). There are great holds for this but they have to be found. Above the overhang you have a choice. 1) Step up left and climb the short angled face on your right with the large crack (the original lead). 2) Move up right and climb straight up the slight overhang on the main face using the first crack on the right for a nice vertical finish. Lay Back & Think Of Ireland’s Eye (VS 4b)** 17m PR: G In the middle of De Southside face is a large blocky overhang. This climb takes the obvious line up the right hand side of this. Start is 6m up from the path junction on the left through the largest (3rd) opening. Climb blocky slab on the right side trending rightwards.Move over to your right to climb around and up the right side of the overhang at the large crack (medium cam). Make a committed move to surmount the slight overhang(crux).Follow the crack leftwards to the small alcove above where you have a choice. 1) Make a delicate swing out right onto the faceand climb straight up to the top (the original lead). 2) Climb straight up the alcove for a satisfying direct finish. Dempsey’s Rocky Road (VS 4b) 24m On De Southside face start on a diagonal crack to the left of the obvious promontory (“the pulpit”) . Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle.

Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

Climb the crack rightwards and clamber on to the top of the pulpit, continue to the right and surmount the vertical crack and bulge (crux) with a good placement below the crux move (as per LB&ToIE). When you make easier ground traverse out to the right and finish up the Arete. Two Bagger Arête (HS 4a) 12m PR: M/G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 2nd arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is through the next opening up from LB&ToIE (4th opening) Move up around right until the 2nd arête is directly above you with a distinct ‘nose’ jutting out as an overhang. At ground level climb the smooth face immediately below the arête with the thin crack (crux) to gain a mini pinnacle just right of the arête. Step across left to gain the arête and proceed up delicate moves directly to the top (ignoring the tempting gully to the left). PR: M/G – Protection is good but there is a short run out at the top (hence HS 4a rating). The top has good hand and footholds and can be bailed either left or right if desired so PR M/G. Three Bagger Arête (VS 4c)* 12m PR: G As for Two Bagger Arête but instead move left around the underside of the nose (protection placement) and make a committed pull up and step right to surmount the nose. PR: G – On the basis that once you’ve hauled yourself over the nose the short run out at the top won’t bother you! Did Anyone See My Golf Ball? (S4a) 13m PR: G The climb follows a direct line from bottom to top going up just left of the 1st arête in from the right hand edge of De Southside face. Start is just right of Two Bagger Arete. Climb up the small alcove and move slightly right to follow a direct line up the left side of the arête ignoring the tempting gully to the left. Fire Alarm (VD 3a) 12m At the extreme right of De Southside face this climb goes up to the right of the arête where a block seems to stand by itself. Clamber up onto a good ledge and climb the groove without dislodging the large loose boulder. At the top climb the cracks to the left to top out easily. ==Sutton to Baily== From the metal gate at the Sutton start of the Cliff Walk (Strand Rd//Shielmartin Rd), follow the footpath past the Martello Tower. A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff.

Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide.

Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

A short distance further on is a yellow warning sign and 50m further on it is possible to descend to the sea and move back under the sign to the base of fine looking slab at least 18m high at its left side. The base of the slab is affected by high tide. This is ===Warning Sign Slab=== Warning Sign Slab location: https://goo.gl/maps/DT2kxXnAaGyoEU4m9 Lucky for Some (V Diff 18m) With a difficult start, climb the left side of the slab using the corner. Good climbing. Lucky Strike (HS 17m) Start at the right edge of the slab. Step up and left and climb the easiest way up the slab more or less directly. Apart from one move half way up this is easier than it looks. An excellent climb.. ===Red Rock=== Red Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/AvJXEEiz3wsidXnp6 Immediately above where the Cliff Walk has steps cut into the rock is an easy angled slab of compact rock. Steps Slab (V Diff 10m) From the steps, the slab is climbed on either the right or, better, the left. Worthwhile. It can also be tackled from 2m left up a short wall at a surprisingly easy standard.. 6-8m left is a short steep red wall which is an obvious (unclimbed?) challenge. Bucket and Slab (Severe 10m) From below the steep red wall climb the slab to below the recess on the left of the red wall. Climb steeply into the recess (with gorse bush). Exit left.. The next 15m left is an area rock with ill-defined features but with a gully/corner at the left end. The next climbs find ways up this area. Grilled (Severe 10m) About 4-5m left of the previous route, climb awkward left trending grooves which are steeper than they appear.. Roasted (VDiff 12m) 2m right of the left facing corner, follow discontinuous ramps up left. Then finish straight up.. Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb. Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

Toasted (Severe 10m) Climb easy angled rock and vegetation to the base of the corner. Start up the corner then step left onto the wall. Either continue left to the edge or, better harder and steeper, climb the wall directly. Poor first half, good second half. Immediately left is a short steep (unclimbed?) yellow wall. 25m left is a, not quite vertical, wall. ====Eurozone==== Punt (V Diff 12m) At the right hand end, climb from the lowest point to the top. A pleasant climb.. Penny (Hard Severe 4a/b 8m) 4-5 metres left of the previous climb, follow the groove into a recess. Climb steeply left and to the top via diagonal cracks. A good climb. Euro (Severe 4a 8m) 1m left of the previous climb, follow the obvious left trending finger crack to the top. Another good climb.

Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point).

Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

Cent (MVS 4b 6m) 3m left climb steeply to finish next to the previous climb. Short but worthwhile. ===Martello Wall=== Martello Wall location: https://goo.gl/maps/NxTs2EV2WovCTJFx8 100+m further on, before the Walk descends to the shore,on the left is an area of steep but broken rocks, about 7-8m high, above the path. The central feature is a wall – a difficult looking problem. Barnacle Boy (S 3c) Found on the left side of Martello Wall. Follow the hand side crack to the ledge, follow the steep slab to the top. Solid rock and good protect, top protected by small offset nuts. Corner Boy (VS 4a 15m) Kevin Coakley, Ian Christie, Climb the obvious crack on right side of the crag, good protection allows bridging to overhang, from small ledge climb through gap to large ledge, easy finish up slab on left to nut belays. ===Sheep Hole Cliffs=== Sheep Hole is below the Cliff Walk at the east end of this length, 5-600 m beyond the previous cliff. I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\". Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring.

Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall. Though this wall reaches from the cliff base, up the slope, to the top, nowhere does it appear to exceed a vertical height of about 6-7m. If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes. Approach from Balscadden Road, jump over a wall, and scramble down to the concrete structure. Fizzecca (HVS/E1 5a/5b?)"

I cannot be sure to what feature the name, Sheep Hole, applies. There are a number of holes underneath the cliff at this point. All this length is tide affected. The first cliff is a small promontory with a steep looking wall on its west side. The left edge of this wall consists of an overhanging prow 8+ metres high which would provide a very hard climb. The main feature of this wall is a right to left diagonal ramp up the full height. Rampant (Diff. 12m) Easily climb the right to left diagonal ramp. A little gem. Man on the Rampage (Sev. 12m) Starting at the same place as Rampant, climb straight up to achieve a ledge by steep rock. The continuation up is loose so carefully follow a foot ramp to the left to top out at a corner. If the doubtfull rock is removed this might become a very worthwhile climb. Ramp Up (V Diff. 12 m) Climb up the front of this promontory. 30 to 50 metres right is another promontory of similar height. The seaward front of the promontory has a wide crack on the left and a corner on the right. The corner is: Bay Watch (V Diff. 11m) Climb the corner to a ledge on the right edge. The last 2 to 3 metres to the top is unsound. ===Ayton’s Cave=== Aytons Cave Location: https://goo.gl/maps/miFVHRNLGKoQBDaAA A cave found in the area of the \"Sheep Hole Cliffs\", a number of difficult bouldering problems are found here, cave is effected by the tide. For more details see Short Span: http://www.theshortspan.com/newproblemdatabase/newproblemdatabase.php or 27 Crags. ===Mussel Cove (with Block)=== Mussel Cove Location: https://goo.gl/maps/VSqDMAKoZVL9a6h89 After Sheep Hole the Cliff Walk by-passes a headland (not Drumleck Point). The east {further)side of the headland forms a shingle cove that contains a large rectangular block 7-8m high. The two shore-facing sides of the Block may provide high standard sport (highball bouldering) barely affected by the tide and with good landings. The top of the block is accessible by scrambling from the seaward facing side of the block. This has been climbed but not recorded. The east facing side of the cove has a large cliff 12+m high. The better looking rock to the left is tide affected. I am told Mick Kellett and friends have made 4-5 climbs on this section. There is an obvious central corner dividing the good from not so good rock (climbed by Des Doyle, no details). Unnamed? (V Diff 12+m) Starting from the base of this corner (but not the corner) is a vague rightwards trending rake that is climbed on, sometimes, dubious rock. ===Rusty Wall=== Rusty Wall Location: https://goo.gl/maps/TMgJZaPjEmLoeqQA7 Less than 100m beyond Mussel Cove, hidden below the Cliff Walk, is a steep rust coloured wall. When in sight of the wooden pole with “Telegraph Cable” marker, follow a vague path from the Cliff Walk down towards a small group of boulders which look precariously poised on a small headland. Descend to the boulders, follow left around the corner to a slight embayment with a small pinnacle at its mouth. At the back of the bay is a wall approximately 12-15m high which overhangs 2-3m. The foot of the wall is undercut and forms a small cave. There are challenging opportunities up the full height of the wall, one of the established routes found here is \"Interdimensional Fucker\".

If the rock is any good there must be possibilities here. ===The Needles (aka The Candlesticks)=== Needles Location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mi8nwGEqX33HbJ5f6 Note: A lot of birdlife around the needles, best to avoid. From Sandy Cove a shore level traverse brings you opposite the two stacks called the Candlesticks. Both are fully exposed at low tide. Immediately east of the Candlesticks is Hippy Hole. This is an east facing cliff of some apparent size and forbidding looks. Access looks as though it may be via a traverse from the Candlesticks at a suitable state of the tide. Half way between the Candlesticks and the Great Baily is Lion’s Head dividing Doldrum Bay from Glenaveena. There may be a cliff on the west side but I have no idea about access. On the South West facing side of the Great Baily promontory are two or three sections of cliff that may be worth exploring. Apart from sea level traverses, access may be difficult (abseils down steep grass?). ==Baily to Howth Village== There are three kilometres of extensive and intimidating sea cliffs on the east of Howth Head between the Nose of Howth at the north end and the Great Baily at the south end. Bill Perrott records “About 20 routes, of varying degree of interest and standard, have been made around here by the Old IMC. These usually take the form of cracks or chimneys; there are also one or two traverses. The usual length of the more vertical climbs does not exceed 60 feet. It is suggested that a continuous traverse from the Nose of Howth to the Baily would be the best expedition!!” It would be interesting if descriptions of any of these routes exist. ===Webs Castle Rock=== Webs Castle Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/8rYux21oUtYEMtZx7 Gerry Moss with Liam Convery refer to some climbs that I understand to have been done on Webb’s Castle Rock, the pyramidal buttress accessible from above, on the south side of Whitewater Brook Bay (north side of the Great Baily). Poor rock is reported!. ===Puck's Rocks=== Pucks Rocks location: https://goo.gl/maps/VTkZB5xAqFNdB9qn9 From the parking place at the end of Balscadden Road follow the Cliff Walk for a few metres and then take a slight track down to the sea at Puck's Rock. There is a square-cut zawn here where Des Doyle and friends have climbed interesting routes of about 15 to 20m up the back wall of the zawn and across the same wall and up the oposite face and corner. There has also been some bouldering at this location, see link below; ===Kilrock Quarry=== Kilrock Quarry location: https://goo.gl/maps/gs6S7h54jQ7V9o1H6 Kilrock Quarry above the car park (commonly used for the \"cliff walk\") at the Howth village (Balscadden Rd) end of the Cliff Walk. The rock face is up to 15m? The quarry is sometimes climbed with top rope as the rock doesn't always have features for placing protection. No known recorded routes. ===Cat Rock=== Cat Rock location: https://goo.gl/maps/XRxXH4zya4rSK8bGA Small rocky outcrop off of Balscadden Road, about 15 meters out to sea. Two recorded routes on the side visible from the road, one of which is a trad route, the other a deep water solo route. Far side of the rock has not been looked at yet for routes.

            "description": "Crumbling Castle E4 6a Excellent climbing with a tricky but well protected crux on an otherwise bold route. Start to the left of Interdimensional Fucker and move delicately up a series of loose flakes to a scooped hold at about 6m, from here two small cams can be placed to protect the crux. Traversing left passed the protection with a dynamic committing move to an excellent side pull marks the start of a technical crux sequence culminating in a big move up to a slopey jug. A couple of moves on less steep terrain brings you to a big ledge which once mantled allows for a deserved rest and at last some protection. Finish up the back wall crack, top out isn't as straight forward as it appears. Interdimensional Fucker (E5/6 6B) 12m A very steep route on dubious rock but with plenty of gear. Weird french 7b-ish climbing. Step off the block and get involved with the triangle groove. A tricky exit out of this gets you to good-ish holds and gear. Sequential and pumpy but well protected (crucial and tricky to place rock 9) climbing above gains the sloping ledge and undercuts/groove. A few moves right on sidepulls and crack (good red camalot and size 10 wire) bring you to flat holds which are followed back left past a small cam to the top. Bring your good set of arms. Headpointed on the first ascent, all gear placed on the lead. Interstellar Hugger E3 5c Similar in style but with an easier, better protected first half than its left neighbour. Juggy start from the block just to the right of Interdimensional Fucker. Some reachy moves to good holds lead to good protection, holds become progressively worse as you move up the left trending crack towards the sloping ledge. A very good rest can be found here with the right body position before attacking the top section (crux). Protected as for IF, route finishes straight up without moving back left. Protect the top out with small cam to avoid the panic while searching for those final holds. Interdimensional Cable E3 6a Committed climbing that is well protected throughout, the easy start gives way to harder moves the further you climb. Begin on the right-hand side of the boulder and pull onto the main wall with good holds. Nice climbing with good gear leads to a good rest once you gain the ledge. Begin the 2nd half of the climb by traversing right using good side pulls and balanced feet to reach a crack where you can arrange your final gear placements before the crux. High feet allow you to gain the incut jug of the left blank wall and then onto the final juggy flakes. Beware some holds and gear placements may not be so obvious. Interdimensional Nutter E2 5c Start on the rightmost corner of the wall, use the right-hand wall to kick up the bouldery start to gain good holds. Continue up easy climbing being careful not to stray too far right onto loose rock. Halfway provides a great rest and a chance to arrange some small cams before starting the harder climbing. Stepping left work your way over an awkward bulge to gain the same final gear placements as its neighbour. A short sequence of committing moves leads to a glory hold before topping out. 300m-400m further on past Drumleck Point is: ===Sandy Cove (with Triffid Slab and Red Dyke Wall)=== Location: https://goo.gl/maps/jaAUgAw6Mx7vsVK96 This Cove is reached by some steps which tunnel through the vegetation. On the south west facing side of the cove is Triffid Slab that may be up to 15m high. There is a rotten chimney in the middle. If belays can be established at the top (which looks problematic without fixed gear), 4 or 5 climbs should prove worthwhile. Triffid Climb (Sev/VDiff 12+m) The right hand edge/rib of the slab is a good climb at a modest standard but without any apparent protection. To get off this route required a frightening battle with the Triffids (escaped South African Fig Plant?). To the right of the Triffid Slab is a Red Dyke Wall.

Climb the chimney and exit right onto the top of the stack. Left-hand Wall 24m. VS Start at the first accessible point to the right and slightly down from the North Chimney start. The climb goes up the steep wall just left of North Chimney. Broken rocks lead to a ledge below the final wall. A belay can be taken here. Go straight up bearing first left and then right. The slight overhang is surmounted by a left arm pull. Hamilton Crack 27m VD This is the crack in the wide re-entrant about 15m right of North Chimney. A good climb. Start at the right hand end of a broad ledge at the foot of the crack proper 1) 9m Easy rocks lead to a ledge at the foot of the crack proper 2) 18m Start slightly left of the crack, traverse in after a couple of moves and follow the crack to the top. Steep but with good holds and plenty of protection Theft 27m S This follows the lower of two diagonal ramps which cross Hamilton Crack, rising from right to left. Start from the ledges connecting the Crows Nest and the foot of Hamilton Crack, at the foot of the diagonal ramp. 1) 20m Gain the ramp either at its beginning or (easier) a little way along, and climb it to a recess (thread runner). Swing round into Hamilton Crack, and climb it for a few steps until the ramp can be regained beyond the crack. Climb the ramp until it ends on a ledge. 2) 7 m. Climb the steep bulging wall above. The holds are large but the rock is doubtful, and care is necessary. This may coincide with the finish of Left-hand Wall. Swing Wing 27 m. VS This follows the upper diagonal ramp crossing Hamilton Crack. Start at the foot of the ramp on the Crows Nest/Hamilton Crack ledges. Climb the ramp. The crux is the awkward swing around the corner towards Hamilton Crack. Skyhook Wa1l 33m S This route lies up the crack in the centre of the rather smooth brown wall low down the gully. Start in a recess crack. 1) 16m Climb the recess to a big ledge; go a short way left up a ramp, and than climb the wall using the crack. Alternatively, go further up the ramp, then traverse back to the crack along a narrow ledge. 2) 17 m. Go straight up over steep but broken rocks to the ledges leading across from the Crows Nest. Continue to the top of the stack either by scrambling to the Crows Nest and finishing by the South East Ridge or moving a few metres left to the foot of Theft. American Express 39 m. VD This follows the chimney on the right wall. The foot of the chimney is defended by a big overhang which is avoided by a traverse from the left. Start: as for Skyhook Wall. 1) 18m. Climb the recess, traverse right along the broad ledge and swing into the chimney. Climb the chimney and exit left 2) 21m. Easier climbing over walls separated by good ledges leads to the Crow's Nest. Southeast Ridge 66m D An excellent route up the longest edge of the Inner Stack. The interest steadily increases and there is considerable exposure on the top pitch which might be graded HS. A classic route. Start at the foot of a chimney reached by scrambling round a few metres to the left from the foot of the big gully. 1) 24m. Climb the chimney, go diagonally right on easy rock to a spacious ledge. Move up a slab on the left and then right to another spacious ledge on the right-hand side of the ridge (The Waiting Room.) 2) 24m. Go up to the right-hand edge for about 4m. A short traverse left brings one to the lower edge of an easy-angled slab. Climb this diagonally left to a ledge on the south face. A short wall leads to a second ledge and the \" dark and evil-smelling chimney\" at the back is climbed to a big ledge (The Crows Nest.) 2a) 21m. Alternatively, continue up the right-hand edge of the ridge, and climb over the overhang (spectacular but easy) which breaks the ridge. A gentle slab leads to the Crows Nest. (Pitches 1 and 2 can easily be broken at good ledges.) 3) 18m. From the left-hand end of the Crow's Nest pull up over the bulge on good holds. Continue up to the foot of the vertical rib. Step left around the base of this and and climb up on good holds. Then move right to the small cave,right again (crux)and straight up to the top. Belay is about 10m back. Mermaid 66m VS Start on the north side of the stack, opposite the Outer Stack, about 5m above high tide, where a crack runs up a corner which overhangs at the top. 1) 45 m. Climb the corne right. Step right at overhang and climb to a good ledge. Move left and then back right, climbing two overlaps to ledge. 2) 21m Climb steep groove above. Traverse the wall to good crack. Climb the crack to chimney. Climb chimney to the top West Chimney 30m S This is actually the obvious chimney in the upper part of the north side of the stack. Start at the North Col 1) 9 m. Traverse across the vertical north-east face of the stack to the base of the chimney. Rather loose. 2) 21 m. Climb the chimney and continue up broken rock to the top of. the stack. (loose chock stones in the chimney). ==Outer Stack== This is now permanently inaccessible because of the density of the gannet population. The sea allows access for about 2 hours on either side of low tide by stepping across boulders in the channel which separates it from the Inner Stack. It tends to be slippery with guano, and is less inviting than the Inner Stack. Most of the climbs start from the White Slab, a large, gently inclined whitish slab, low down on the Howth side of the stack. Having crossed the channel, reach the White Slab by one of two routes, (a) 9m Climb the wall bearing slightly right and surmount an overhanging bulge (VD) Belay well back on slab. (b) 13m. Traverse right to a point where the wall is low, and step around onto the slab (M) Taman Shud 27m VS Start at the belay on White Slab. 1) 12m From the top of the bulge on access route (a) a progressively narrowing shelf runs up to the left. Follow this until it merges into the vertical face. Continue left for a few feet until it is possible to make a long step left into the bottom of a crack. Climb the crack with difficulty. Easier climbing leads to a good ledge. 2) 15m Easy climbing leads to the summit. South Ridge 20m VD Start as for Taman Shud. 1) 11m go up to a corner on a slabby ledge, covered in guano to a good belay. 2) 9m Traverse right to the edge of the ridge and then go directly up to the summit. Outer Stack Ordinary 50m M This is the normal descent route. From the belay on the White Slab, walk across to the obvious v-corner and climb it. Walk to the left across vegetation for about 20m and take the easiest way up the rocks to the top of the pinnacle. Corner and Ridge 65m D Follow the Ordinary Route to the top of the v-corner. Go along a good ledge to the right and crawl round a corner below an overhang. Climb up and to the right to reach the crest of the main ridge of the stack. Scramble along this and climb the pinnacle. ==Inaccessible Pinnacle== This is the smallest stack, to the SW. of the Outer Stack. It is accessible except at high tide by descending the big gully, and scrambling across boulders to the inshore corner of the stack. Routes are described from here. Descent is generally by abseil. The Ridge 17m VD This is the obvious ridge facing the shore. A good little climb. Start at the foot of the wall, just left of the overhang in the ridge. 1) 8 m Climb the smooth wall via some cracks to a fine stance above the overhanging section of the ridge. 2) 9m Continue straight up the ridge to the top. Skyward 15m HS Start a few feet left of the ridge. Pull up onto a ledge, traverse left to blocks and obvious flake. Climb directly above flake and move right and pull onto ledge. Step to right and climb direct to the top. The Traverse 24m D Old IMC Start as for the Ridge. 1) 15m Traverse left across the slab at about high tide level, and then go around the corner onto the seaward side of stack. Climb the slab to a small stance. 2) 9m Easier climbing to the top of the stack. NB. Changes in the boulders at the foot of the climb may have made this climb more difficult, or even impossible. ==The Main Cliffs== These are on the north coast of the Island From the stacks walk across the island to descend on the east side of the main and highest part of the cliff. A vague path runs down towards the highest part of the cliff, ending about 30m above the sea. The first route starts near the edge of the rock at the top of the steep vegetated slope leading down to the sea OCTOPUS 25m S Takes the obvious right-trending break with steep rock to the left and a steep slab to the right. Startup a short steep corner with crack to gain a ledge. Climb the awkward corner to the right and follow the obvious line to the top. Rock generally sound with good protection. The next route starts 12m further along the path DELIVERANCE 35m VS Start 10m down track at left-hand side of the cliff, at two small grooves right of a cave. Climb right-hand groove and exit right. Climb slab and short vertical section on good holds. Climb obvious right-angled groove and exit with difficulty to thread and nut belays. 12m beyond this the path ends and overlooks a deep gully bounded on the far side by the Main Face and Eye Opener. Above the end of the path is an arete. The next route follows the left side of this. SQUID 45m. HS Climb up on the left of the arete and move further left across vegetated rock to gain a steep corner with shaky blocks. Continue up the corner and over more blocks to move across and up an airy corner to a niche. Climb the superb crack line above to the top. Belay well back. Protection good. EYE OPENER 60m S. Start at high tide level to the right of the large cave, beneath and left of a ramp/corner on the right side of the main cliff. at high tide level to the right of the large cave, beneath and left of a ramp/corner on the right side of the main cliff. 1) 20m. Gain the start of the ramp/corner and climb it relying on fist jams, main difficulty is low down. Continue until the ramp levels off at a huge flake. 2) 20m Follow the ramp to the right-hand side of the cliff. Step down a bit and to the right then to a large bollard (very exposed). 3) 10m Climb vertically upwards for about 2m to a nose. Step out right (crux) and climb flake above steeply right to a tridented step in the ridge on the right-hand skyline. 4) 30m. Traverse right to the foot of an easy-looking groove and climb, scramble, gaunter and ascend ever upwards. PHILATELY 35m HS Start on the right-hand side of the main cliff at a groove beside a small cave. Climb groove and enter crack on right. Climb crack and up easy ground to finish. On the west of the island, a little north of a high cliff, easy approach. RUBBER DUCK 27m. S. Start about 2 m right of a bulgy overhang, the first obvious line of weakness runs diagonally right. Climb 5m to a difficult move right on the wall below the ascending crack. At 9m gain a bird-spoilt ledge. Continue up right over bulges to the top. BIG BEAR 38m HS 40m right of 'Rubber Duck', where it is difficult to proceed any further, lies Big Bear. Start up left of the protruding spur moving left over loose rock and vegetation to below a wide chockstone-filled crack. Climb this to a stance above. Move right to below an overhang. Exit right to a steep forked crack. Finish directly or to the right. The next two routes can be located by going east from the Martello Tower to the last promontory before the main cliff. Scramble down the gully on the east side of the promontory and traverse left at sea level to the extreme edge. Alternatively abseil from above. SALTY DOG 15m S Climb edge for 11m, traverse right into awkward chimney. Move up slightly then left through the narrow exit. SALTPETRE 15m S P. Norton, D. Doyle, 1st October D. About 3m left of Salty Dog there is a depression. Do not let this affect you but climb up steeply, following the right-hand edge of the depression, to the top. MEINDL CHIMNEY 12m VD At low tide descend the steep, rocky slope just left of the first large inlet east of the Martello tower to sea level. Traverse about 20m left to the base of the obvious chimney with the text-book chock stone at the top. Ascend the chimney, being careful of loose rock in the last 3m and squeeze up behind the revolving chock stone. SLACK 11m S In the second large inlet there are four incuts. The climb is in the rightmost (dry) of these. Scramble down from the right of the incut to the grassy ledge below an obvious gully near the left end of the incut and start about 2m left of the bottom of the gully. Climb diagonally up to the top of the gully and up this to the top. Poor, brittle and loose rock."

The holds are large but the rock is doubtful, and care is necessary. This may coincide with the finish of Left-hand Wall. Swing Wing 27 m. VS This follows the upper diagonal ramp crossing Hamilton Crack. Start at the foot of the ramp on the Crows Nest/Hamilton Crack ledges. Climb the ramp. The crux is the awkward swing around the corner towards Hamilton Crack. Skyhook Wa1l 33m S This route lies up the crack in the centre of the rather smooth brown wall low down the gully. Start in a recess crack. 1) 16m Climb the recess to a big ledge; go a short way left up a ramp, and than climb the wall using the crack. Alternatively, go further up the ramp, then traverse back to the crack along a narrow ledge. 2) 17 m. Go straight up over steep but broken rocks to the ledges leading across from the Crows Nest. Continue to the top of the stack either by scrambling to the Crows Nest and finishing by the South East Ridge or moving a few metres left to the foot of Theft. American Express 39 m. VD This follows the chimney on the right wall. The foot of the chimney is defended by a big overhang which is avoided by a traverse from the left. Start: as for Skyhook Wall. 1) 18m. Climb the recess, traverse right along the broad ledge and swing into the chimney. Climb the chimney and exit left 2) 21m. Easier climbing over walls separated by good ledges leads to the Crow's Nest. Southeast Ridge 66m D An excellent route up the longest edge of the Inner Stack. The interest steadily increases and there is considerable exposure on the top pitch which might be graded HS. A classic route. Start at the foot of a chimney reached by scrambling round a few metres to the left from the foot of the big gully. 1) 24m. Climb the chimney, go diagonally right on easy rock to a spacious ledge. Move up a slab on the left and then right to another spacious ledge on the right-hand side of the ridge (The Waiting Room.) 2) 24m. Go up to the right-hand edge for about 4m. A short traverse left brings one to the lower edge of an easy-angled slab. Climb this diagonally left to a ledge on the south face. A short wall leads to a second ledge and the \" dark and evil-smelling chimney\" at the back is climbed to a big ledge (The Crows Nest.) 2a) 21m. Alternatively, continue up the right-hand edge of the ridge, and climb over the overhang (spectacular but easy) which breaks the ridge. A gentle slab leads to the Crows Nest. (Pitches 1 and 2 can easily be broken at good ledges.) 3) 18m. From the left-hand end of the Crow's Nest pull up over the bulge on good holds. Continue up to the foot of the vertical rib. Step left around the base of this and and climb up on good holds. Then move right to the small cave,right again (crux)and straight up to the top. Belay is about 10m back. Mermaid 66m VS Start on the north side of the stack, opposite the Outer Stack, about 5m above high tide, where a crack runs up a corner which overhangs at the top. 1) 45 m. Climb the corne right. Step right at overhang and climb to a good ledge. Move left and then back right, climbing two overlaps to ledge. 2) 21m Climb steep groove above. Traverse the wall to good crack. Climb the crack to chimney. Climb chimney to the top West Chimney 30m S This is actually the obvious chimney in the upper part of the north side of the stack. Start at the North Col 1) 9 m. Traverse across the vertical north-east face of the stack to the base of the chimney. Rather loose. 2) 21 m. Climb the chimney and continue up broken rock to the top of. the stack. (loose chock stones in the chimney). ==Outer Stack== This is now permanently inaccessible because of the density of the gannet population. The sea allows access for about 2 hours on either side of low tide by stepping across boulders in the channel which separates it from the Inner Stack. It tends to be slippery with guano, and is less inviting than the Inner Stack. Most of the climbs start from the White Slab, a large, gently inclined whitish slab, low down on the Howth side of the stack. Having crossed the channel, reach the White Slab by one of two routes, (a) 9m Climb the wall bearing slightly right and surmount an overhanging bulge (VD) Belay well back on slab. (b) 13m. Traverse right to a point where the wall is low, and step around onto the slab (M) Taman Shud 27m VS Start at the belay on White Slab. 1) 12m From the top of the bulge on access route (a) a progressively narrowing shelf runs up to the left. Follow this until it merges into the vertical face. Continue left for a few feet until it is possible to make a long step left into the bottom of a crack. Climb the crack with difficulty. Easier climbing leads to a good ledge. 2) 15m Easy climbing leads to the summit. South Ridge 20m VD Start as for Taman Shud. 1) 11m go up to a corner on a slabby ledge, covered in guano to a good belay. 2) 9m Traverse right to the edge of the ridge and then go directly up to the summit. Outer Stack Ordinary 50m M This is the normal descent route. From the belay on the White Slab, walk across to the obvious v-corner and climb it. Walk to the left across vegetation for about 20m and take the easiest way up the rocks to the top of the pinnacle. Corner and Ridge 65m D Follow the Ordinary Route to the top of the v-corner. Go along a good ledge to the right and crawl round a corner below an overhang. Climb up and to the right to reach the crest of the main ridge of the stack. Scramble along this and climb the pinnacle. ==Inaccessible Pinnacle== This is the smallest stack, to the SW. of the Outer Stack. It is accessible except at high tide by descending the big gully, and scrambling across boulders to the inshore corner of the stack. Routes are described from here. Descent is generally by abseil. The Ridge 17m VD This is the obvious ridge facing the shore. A good little climb. Start at the foot of the wall, just left of the overhang in the ridge. 1) 8 m Climb the smooth wall via some cracks to a fine stance above the overhanging section of the ridge. 2) 9m Continue straight up the ridge to the top. Skyward 15m HS Start a few feet left of the ridge. Pull up onto a ledge, traverse left to blocks and obvious flake. Climb directly above flake and move right and pull onto ledge.

Changes in the boulders at the foot of the climb may have made this climb more difficult, or even impossible. ==The Main Cliffs== These are on the north coast of the Island From the stacks walk across the island to descend on the east side of the main and highest part of the cliff. A vague path runs down towards the highest part of the cliff, ending about 30m above the sea. The first route starts near the edge of the rock at the top of the steep vegetated slope leading down to the sea OCTOPUS 25m S Takes the obvious right-trending break with steep rock to the left and a steep slab to the right. Startup a short steep corner with crack to gain a ledge. Climb the awkward corner to the right and follow the obvious line to the top. Rock generally sound with good protection. The next route starts 12m further along the path DELIVERANCE 35m VS Start 10m down track at left-hand side of the cliff, at two small grooves right of a cave. Climb right-hand groove and exit right. Climb slab and short vertical section on good holds. Climb obvious right-angled groove and exit with difficulty to thread and nut belays. 12m beyond this the path ends and overlooks a deep gully bounded on the far side by the Main Face and Eye Opener. Above the end of the path is an arete. The next route follows the left side of this. SQUID 45m. HS Climb up on the left of the arete and move further left across vegetated rock to gain a steep corner with shaky blocks. Continue up the corner and over more blocks to move across and up an airy corner to a niche. Climb the superb crack line above to the top. Belay well back. Protection good. EYE OPENER 60m S.

Traverse across the vertical north-east face of the stack to the base of the chimney. Rather loose. 2) 21 m. Climb the chimney and continue up broken rock to the top of. the stack. (loose chock stones in the chimney). ==Outer Stack== This is now permanently inaccessible because of the density of the gannet population. The sea allows access for about 2 hours on either side of low tide by stepping across boulders in the channel which separates it from the Inner Stack. It tends to be slippery with guano, and is less inviting than the Inner Stack. Most of the climbs start from the White Slab, a large, gently inclined whitish slab, low down on the Howth side of the stack. Having crossed the channel, reach the White Slab by one of two routes, (a) 9m Climb the wall bearing slightly right and surmount an overhanging bulge (VD) Belay well back on slab. (b) 13m. Traverse right to a point where the wall is low, and step around onto the slab (M) Taman Shud 27m VS Start at the belay on White Slab. 1) 12m From the top of the bulge on access route (a) a progressively narrowing shelf runs up to the left.

Outer Stack Ordinary 50m M This is the normal descent route. From the belay on the White Slab, walk across to the obvious v-corner and climb it. Walk to the left across vegetation for about 20m and take the easiest way up the rocks to the top of the pinnacle. Corner and Ridge 65m D Follow the Ordinary Route to the top of the v-corner. Go along a good ledge to the right and crawl round a corner below an overhang. Climb up and to the right to reach the crest of the main ridge of the stack. Scramble along this and climb the pinnacle. ==Inaccessible Pinnacle== This is the smallest stack, to the SW. of the Outer Stack. It is accessible except at high tide by descending the big gully, and scrambling across boulders to the inshore corner of the stack. Routes are described from here. Descent is generally by abseil. The Ridge 17m VD This is the obvious ridge facing the shore. A good little climb. Start at the foot of the wall, just left of the overhang in the ridge. 1) 8 m Climb the smooth wall via some cracks to a fine stance above the overhanging section of the ridge. 2) 9m Continue straight up the ridge to the top. Skyward 15m HS Start a few feet left of the ridge. Pull up onto a ledge, traverse left to blocks and obvious flake. Climb directly above flake and move right and pull onto ledge.

These climbs are not quite as described by H.J.; they have been altered a little to give three near separate lines. Safety Second 6m Font 6a D. Flanagan 07/12/14 Follow the line of least resistance up the middle of the south facing wall. A highball boulder problem rather than a route. Go straight up broken rock, and then pull up over a bulge to reach a ledge. Traverse R. into the crack (this is the reverse of Flake Route traverse) and finish as Crack Direct. From the top of Quartz Crag, walk south descending a few feet along the base of a very broken rock wall. At the far end of this, about level with the middle of Quartz Crag, there is a small square tower. Harold's Cross 7m V Diff Start: Directly below the tower. Climb across a slab, and make two mantleshelf moves to reach a block below the final overhang, which is climbed direct (awkward and strenuous). It is possible to escape to the L.

Diff Start: At the foot of the black broken rock just R. of the main overhang on the south face. Climb the fault. This is quite strenuous, but the rock is (fortunately!) sounder than it looks. Finish up the narrow V-notch between the south face overhang and a big prow. Awkward and strenuous. ==EUGENE'S PINNACLE.== From the bottom of Charlie’s Wall walk 20 m. south, and descend to an attractive little pinnacle North West Face 7m S Start: At the foot of the pinnacle, just above two flakes. Climb to a small ledge 2.54 m. (the original description carefully specifies 8ft. 4 ins!) from the ground (strenuous and off-balance). Balance delicately on the ledge, feeling to the L. for a crack which provides a much-needed side pull. Jug handles above lead to a strenuous finish. Right Hand Route 7m Diff Start: As for North West Face. Climb up the steep wall on good holds to the top. Cracked Wall H. Johnston Somewhere in this area H.J.’s guide has CRACKED WALL, which the present editors failed to identify.

Cracked Wall Diff The main obvious centre crack Cracked Wall Diff The thin lefthand crack Unknown Diff The slab and overhang around the righthand corner While searching for Cracked Wall, the editors found a vertical wall About 40m. above Eugene’s Pinnacle. Near the middle there is a square chimney, and leading left from this point is a slab finishing in a crack. Square Chimney 6m Diff Climb the chimney, which overhangs slightly, on good holds. Tree Chimney 26m S To the L. of Steep Slab there is a formidable overhanging wall. The route is here. Start: at the foot of the tree. 1) 13m. Climb the overhanging wall by backing up the tree! \"In a high wind the tree sways and one is liable to be pinched. Also sometimes one has the impression that the rock itself is moving, which is disconcerting\". 2) 6m. An easy scramble. 3. 7m. A hard vertical wall. Steep Slab * 38m VD A good climb, probably the best in the Scalp. It is quite hard of its grade, and has both delicate and strenuous moves. Start at the bottom of the slab. 1) 14 m. Start up the small overhang, moving diagonally left onto the main slab. Then follow the right edge of the slab (thin move at 10m) and take a thread belay at a boulder in the gully right of the slab about 3 m. below the top of the slab. 2) 12m. Traverse left across the top of the slab, then climb the left side of the little wall and go up the slab to easy ground. Walk about 10 m. to the foot of a wall. 3) 7 m. Climb the steep but easy wall (4) 5m. Stand on the boulder and pull up over the overhang. About level with the top pitch of Steep Slab, and a little further south is a small buttress split by a crack, with a tree at the bottom. Here is Conifer Crack 6m D Quite hard. Chimney up using the tree to the foot of the crack. Step delicately out left onto the slab, and climb to the top, finishing in the crack. ==East Buttress== Winter Solstice 24m D Easy. Start at the foot of the buttress beside a detached block. 1)14m. Climb up steep rock on good holds left of the detached block, then swing right onto the slab. Climb easier rock bearing right to the foot of a wall, right of a V-groove. 2)10m Climb the steep little wall ahead to easy ground, then bear left and up the nose to the top. Diamond Flake 11m D L. Convery, . J. Lynam, Nick Lynam (leads shared), 21st September l975 A diamond-shaped flake lies against the left wall of the buttress, directly below a birch tree on the buttress crest. Start at the bottom of the flake. Climb the right side of the flake (or the left, harder) to where it abuts against the wall. Climb the wall on large holds (watch out for loose rock) and finish left of the birch tree. ==Rothery's Rocks== Near the south end of The Scalp is another group of interesting rocks, which Sean Rothery explored. The editors found two good problems:- The Pinnacle 4m VD The north side of the obvious little pinnacle offers a short interesting problem in side pulls. The Two Tiers 10m VD Start at the foot of the buttress below a leftward trending slab. 1) 6 m. Climb the slab and then the wall above just right of a crack to reach a broad ledge. 2) 4m Climb the layback crack in the wall above. There is a good finishing jug handle! ==The West Side== Half way through The Scalp, at the parking place described earlier, look straight up the rocky western side. There are three obvious rock formations near the top. The largest one is in the centre and has two routes. A rough path leadsup to the foot of it. Walsh Rarebit 17m VD \"So called because after some years of absence due to matrimony the Walsh brothers, Paddy and John, found themselves on the rocks again, and encouraged by their sister Margaret, formed 50% of the party.\" Start just left of the lowest point of the buttress, near the path, at a crack. 1) 6m Climb the crack, which is quite hard to emerge from. 2) 8m From the grassy ledge climb the main crag by a crack in the centre. This leads to the right and after an awkward move you come out onto heather near the top of the crag.(3) 3m. An easy scramble to the top. March Hare 18m VD To the right of Walsh Rarebit is a recess and a slab with a diedre running diagonally right 1)7m. Climb into the diedre, move right to the edge and then straight up to the grassy ledge. 2) 8m. A couple of metres to the left there is a big horizontal flake. Climb onto this, then go right to the edge and up by the crack to the top of pitch 2 of Walsh Rarebit. 3) 3 m. As for Walsh Rarebit. The crag to the right of these climbs has a fine overhanging nose on it's right side and gives a couple of fun and worthwhile wee routes: Path of Hands 9m E1 5c. Climb blocks belos the left arête to gain the hanging slab. move right onto Arete and place protection. from here launch upwards to top. Could be HS. Scalped 9m E5 6a.

Cracked Wall Diff The main obvious centre crack Cracked Wall Diff The thin lefthand crack Unknown Diff The slab and overhang around the righthand corner While searching for Cracked Wall, the editors found a vertical wall About 40m. above Eugene’s Pinnacle. Near the middle there is a square chimney, and leading left from this point is a slab finishing in a crack. Square Chimney 6m Diff Climb the chimney, which overhangs slightly, on good holds. Tree Chimney 26m S To the L. of Steep Slab there is a formidable overhanging wall. The route is here. Start: at the foot of the tree. 1) 13m. Climb the overhanging wall by backing up the tree! \"In a high wind the tree sways and one is liable to be pinched. Also sometimes one has the impression that the rock itself is moving, which is disconcerting\". 2) 6m. An easy scramble. 3. 7m. A hard vertical wall. Steep Slab * 38m VD A good climb, probably the best in the Scalp. It is quite hard of its grade, and has both delicate and strenuous moves. Start at the bottom of the slab. 1) 14 m. Start up the small overhang, moving diagonally left onto the main slab. Then follow the right edge of the slab (thin move at 10m) and take a thread belay at a boulder in the gully right of the slab about 3 m. below the top of the slab. 2) 12m. Traverse left across the top of the slab, then climb the left side of the little wall and go up the slab to easy ground. Walk about 10 m. to the foot of a wall. 3) 7 m. Climb the steep but easy wall (4) 5m. Stand on the boulder and pull up over the overhang. About level with the top pitch of Steep Slab, and a little further south is a small buttress split by a crack, with a tree at the bottom. Here is Conifer Crack 6m D Quite hard. Chimney up using the tree to the foot of the crack. Step delicately out left onto the slab, and climb to the top, finishing in the crack. ==East Buttress== Winter Solstice 24m D Easy. Start at the foot of the buttress beside a detached block. 1)14m. Climb up steep rock on good holds left of the detached block, then swing right onto the slab. Climb easier rock bearing right to the foot of a wall, right of a V-groove. 2)10m Climb the steep little wall ahead to easy ground, then bear left and up the nose to the top. Diamond Flake 11m D L. Convery, . J. Lynam, Nick Lynam (leads shared), 21st September l975 A diamond-shaped flake lies against the left wall of the buttress, directly below a birch tree on the buttress crest. Start at the bottom of the flake. Climb the right side of the flake (or the left, harder) to where it abuts against the wall. Climb the wall on large holds (watch out for loose rock) and finish left of the birch tree. ==Rothery's Rocks== Near the south end of The Scalp is another group of interesting rocks, which Sean Rothery explored. The editors found two good problems:- The Pinnacle 4m VD The north side of the obvious little pinnacle offers a short interesting problem in side pulls. The Two Tiers 10m VD Start at the foot of the buttress below a leftward trending slab. 1) 6 m. Climb the slab and then the wall above just right of a crack to reach a broad ledge. 2) 4m Climb the layback crack in the wall above. There is a good finishing jug handle! ==The West Side== Half way through The Scalp, at the parking place described earlier, look straight up the rocky western side. There are three obvious rock formations near the top. The largest one is in the centre and has two routes. A rough path leadsup to the foot of it. Walsh Rarebit 17m VD \"So called because after some years of absence due to matrimony the Walsh brothers, Paddy and John, found themselves on the rocks again, and encouraged by their sister Margaret, formed 50% of the party.\" Start just left of the lowest point of the buttress, near the path, at a crack. 1) 6m Climb the crack, which is quite hard to emerge from. 2) 8m From the grassy ledge climb the main crag by a crack in the centre. This leads to the right and after an awkward move you come out onto heather near the top of the crag.(3) 3m. An easy scramble to the top. March Hare 18m VD To the right of Walsh Rarebit is a recess and a slab with a diedre running diagonally right 1)7m. Climb into the diedre, move right to the edge and then straight up to the grassy ledge. 2) 8m. A couple of metres to the left there is a big horizontal flake. Climb onto this, then go right to the edge and up by the crack to the top of pitch 2 of Walsh Rarebit. 3) 3 m. As for Walsh Rarebit. The crag to the right of these climbs has a fine overhanging nose on it's right side and gives a couple of fun and worthwhile wee routes: Path of Hands 9m E1 5c. Climb blocks belos the left arête to gain the hanging slab. move right onto Arete and place protection. from here launch upwards to top. Could be HS. Scalped 9m E5 6a. Climb to under overlap (crucial peenut 2), then bust some moves through this and up to the second quartzy break (good cams). A tricky mantel leaves you standing on the top."

            "description": "There was no Irish Mountaineering Club in those days and I did not know of any other Irish climbers, so friends and relations were trapped into ‘going for a nice walk’. When The Scalp was reached, a rope and spare nailed boots were produced and the victim was tied on and dragged up ‘Steep Slab’ or ‘Quartz Crag’. Alas few ever came again and it became increasingly hard to tempt anyone to come climbing One day I saw an advertisement in the Evening Mail - ‘two bored young men, tired of life, want a new thrill’. I answered this, brought them to The Scalp but even they never came again. Apparently, it was too much of a thrill You have no idea how desperately lonely it was to have no-one to climb with and no-one even to talk to about mountains in those days. Everyone in Ireland thought rock-climbing was crazy and I used to long for the friendship of other climbers. It is wonderful nowadays to have dozens of I.M.C. Members to climb with and very pleasant to see other men and girls with ropes slung over their shoulders and climbing boots on their feet. Climbs in The Scalp are vary short but the beauty of the surroundings and views of the Dublin and Wicklow Mountains make it a very pleasant place to scramble in. THE EAST SIDE The climbs are described starting from the Dublin (North) end of The Scalp. Shortly after passing the Tea Rooms (petrol station), there is a gap on the opposite side of the road. Go through it and walk towards Bray for 70 paces parallel to the road (girls with short legs walk 85 paces). Scramble up over the boulders. ==Quartz Crag== About half way up the side of The Scalp 30m above the road, there is a large mass of rock with a crack running diagonally up the face from bottom L. to top R. Near the top, there is a sprinkling of Quartz. This is Quartz Crag. Flake Route 12m D Start: At the bottom of the detached flake, just R. of a holly bush. Climb the west face of the flake. From the top traverse slightly L. step into the crack which is followed to a ledge (runner). Traverse L. along the ledge for about 3m and climb quartz knobs to the top (take care the quartz does not pull off). Crack Direct 10m V. Diff Start: At the foot of the L. branch of the inverted Y-crack which splits the crag. Climb the crack. There is an awkward traverse move R. where the two cracks join (keep high). Keep on up the crack past a ledge above which it becomes a chimney (runner), best climbed facing R. Crack - Left Entrance 11m V. Diff Start: As for Crack Direct. Go straight up broken rock, and then pull up over a bulge to reach a ledge. Traverse R. into the crack (this is the reverse of Flake Route traverse) and finish as Crack Direct. These climbs are not quite as described by H.J.; they have been altered a little to give three near separate lines. Safety Second 6m Font 6a D. Flanagan 07/12/14 Follow the line of least resistance up the middle of the south facing wall. A highball boulder problem rather than a route. Go straight up broken rock, and then pull up over a bulge to reach a ledge. Traverse R. into the crack (this is the reverse of Flake Route traverse) and finish as Crack Direct. From the top of Quartz Crag, walk south descending a few feet along the base of a very broken rock wall. At the far end of this, about level with the middle of Quartz Crag, there is a small square tower. Harold's Cross 7m V Diff Start: Directly below the tower. Climb across a slab, and make two mantleshelf moves to reach a block below the final overhang, which is climbed direct (awkward and strenuous). It is possible to escape to the L. From the top of this climb walk 12 m. east, then descend a little to Charlie’s Wall, which has yielded several routes West Face Edge 7m Diff Start: At the junction of the overhanging south face and the easier angled west face. Climb up. the corner, first on small holds, and then on jugs, to the top. Mona's Route 7m Diff An alternative route just L. of West Face Edge. Black Fault 8m V. Diff Start: At the foot of the black broken rock just R. of the main overhang on the south face. Climb the fault. This is quite strenuous, but the rock is (fortunately!) sounder than it looks. Finish up the narrow V-notch between the south face overhang and a big prow. Awkward and strenuous. ==EUGENE'S PINNACLE.== From the bottom of Charlie’s Wall walk 20 m. south, and descend to an attractive little pinnacle North West Face 7m S Start: At the foot of the pinnacle, just above two flakes. Climb to a small ledge 2.54 m. (the original description carefully specifies 8ft. 4 ins!) from the ground (strenuous and off-balance). Balance delicately on the ledge, feeling to the L. for a crack which provides a much-needed side pull. Jug handles above lead to a strenuous finish. Right Hand Route 7m Diff Start: As for North West Face. Climb up the steep wall on good holds to the top. Cracked Wall H. Johnston Somewhere in this area H.J.’s guide has CRACKED WALL, which the present editors failed to identify. The description below is copied from the old guide: \"From the base of Eugene’s Pinnacle traverse to the R. to a 22 ft. wall with prominent cracks running vertically up it. Cracked Wall Diff The main obvious centre crack Cracked Wall Diff The thin lefthand crack Unknown Diff The slab and overhang around the righthand corner While searching for Cracked Wall, the editors found a vertical wall About 40m. above Eugene’s Pinnacle. Near the middle there is a square chimney, and leading left from this point is a slab finishing in a crack. Square Chimney 6m Diff Climb the chimney, which overhangs slightly, on good holds. Tree Chimney 26m S To the L. of Steep Slab there is a formidable overhanging wall. The route is here. Start: at the foot of the tree. 1) 13m. Climb the overhanging wall by backing up the tree! \"In a high wind the tree sways and one is liable to be pinched. Also sometimes one has the impression that the rock itself is moving, which is disconcerting\". 2) 6m. An easy scramble. 3. 7m. A hard vertical wall. Steep Slab * 38m VD A good climb, probably the best in the Scalp. It is quite hard of its grade, and has both delicate and strenuous moves. Start at the bottom of the slab. 1) 14 m. Start up the small overhang, moving diagonally left onto the main slab. Then follow the right edge of the slab (thin move at 10m) and take a thread belay at a boulder in the gully right of the slab about 3 m. below the top of the slab. 2) 12m. Traverse left across the top of the slab, then climb the left side of the little wall and go up the slab to easy ground. Walk about 10 m. to the foot of a wall. 3) 7 m. Climb the steep but easy wall (4) 5m. Stand on the boulder and pull up over the overhang. About level with the top pitch of Steep Slab, and a little further south is a small buttress split by a crack, with a tree at the bottom. Here is Conifer Crack 6m D Quite hard. Chimney up using the tree to the foot of the crack. Step delicately out left onto the slab, and climb to the top, finishing in the crack. ==East Buttress== Winter Solstice 24m D Easy. Start at the foot of the buttress beside a detached block. 1)14m. Climb up steep rock on good holds left of the detached block, then swing right onto the slab. Climb easier rock bearing right to the foot of a wall, right of a V-groove. 2)10m Climb the steep little wall ahead to easy ground, then bear left and up the nose to the top. Diamond Flake 11m D L. Convery, . J. Lynam, Nick Lynam (leads shared), 21st September l975 A diamond-shaped flake lies against the left wall of the buttress, directly below a birch tree on the buttress crest. Start at the bottom of the flake. Climb the right side of the flake (or the left, harder) to where it abuts against the wall. Climb the wall on large holds (watch out for loose rock) and finish left of the birch tree. ==Rothery's Rocks== Near the south end of The Scalp is another group of interesting rocks, which Sean Rothery explored. The editors found two good problems:- The Pinnacle 4m VD The north side of the obvious little pinnacle offers a short interesting problem in side pulls. The Two Tiers 10m VD Start at the foot of the buttress below a leftward trending slab. 1) 6 m. Climb the slab and then the wall above just right of a crack to reach a broad ledge. 2) 4m Climb the layback crack in the wall above. There is a good finishing jug handle! ==The West Side== Half way through The Scalp, at the parking place described earlier, look straight up the rocky western side. There are three obvious rock formations near the top. The largest one is in the centre and has two routes. A rough path leadsup to the foot of it. Walsh Rarebit 17m VD \"So called because after some years of absence due to matrimony the Walsh brothers, Paddy and John, found themselves on the rocks again, and encouraged by their sister Margaret, formed 50% of the party.\" Start just left of the lowest point of the buttress, near the path, at a crack. 1) 6m Climb the crack, which is quite hard to emerge from. 2) 8m From the grassy ledge climb the main crag by a crack in the centre. This leads to the right and after an awkward move you come out onto heather near the top of the crag.(3) 3m. An easy scramble to the top. March Hare 18m VD To the right of Walsh Rarebit is a recess and a slab with a diedre running diagonally right 1)7m. Climb into the diedre, move right to the edge and then straight up to the grassy ledge. 2) 8m. A couple of metres to the left there is a big horizontal flake. Climb onto this, then go right to the edge and up by the crack to the top of pitch 2 of Walsh Rarebit. 3) 3 m. As for Walsh Rarebit. The crag to the right of these climbs has a fine overhanging nose on it's right side and gives a couple of fun and worthwhile wee routes: Path of Hands 9m E1 5c. Climb blocks belos the left arête to gain the hanging slab. move right onto Arete and place protection. from here launch upwards to top. Could be HS. Scalped 9m E5 6a. Climb to under overlap (crucial peenut 2), then bust some moves through this and up to the second quartzy break (good cams). A tricky mantel leaves you standing on the top."
