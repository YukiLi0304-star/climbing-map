Follow the crack to small overhang which is climbed directly. Continue up the corner enjoying the protection. **Dodgems** 28m HS 4a D Stelfox, J Clark. 7/1978. The right-hand arête of the Castle Gully area. Start on the gully wall just right of Debbie, gain the arête and follow it to the top with minimal protection. **Close to the Edge** 28m HVS 5b P Douglas, C Calow, J Codling. 7/1979. A direct start to Dodgems starting from the road at the foot of the arête. **Roadside Attraction** * 21m HVS 5a M Geary, P Wright. 3/1981. The first crack right of Close to the Edge joining the arête at half-height. **Mister Guilty** * 21m HVS 5a T McQueen, P Thompson. 6/1981. The crack immediately right of Roadside Attraction. Follow the crack until it closes at half-height. Move slightly right and up an easier-angled section. Pull back left onto the ledge and follow the grass ledges to the top. **Nokey's Arête** 20m HVS 5a I Rea, M Rea, G Banks. 17/4/1982. 7m to the right of Mister Guilty there is a steel post. Start 5m right of this at a prominent corner. Climb a slabby wall immediately right of the corner until it is possible to step right onto good footholds on the arête. Climb directly to the top."

It takes a high right-facing open corner left of An Bealach Runda for its crux (top) pitch and this is reached by the crack/groove which runs up to the right-hand end of the grassy terrace below this corner. Start at the foot of this crack/groove line about 30m left of An Bealach Runda. 1) 30m (5a). Climb the crack (continuous bridging on the right). Belay on a good ledge above the crack. 2) 21m (4c). Continue up the groove to an entertaining chockstone and move out left. Reach the terrace and cross it to belay at the foot of the corner. 3) 39m (5b). Climb wide crack (awkward) to reach the corner and climb this to an inhospitable little niche 5m below the top. Move out right to a flat ledge and then finish up directly."

Move left to gain the depression which is crossed on large flint bollards. Straight up to the top and belay on the metal spike. **Heckler** 40m VS M Henry, M Curran (Alternate Lead). 1/6/72. A fine airy route with good protection throughout. The line follows the prominent groove on the right-hand side of the main wall. Start at the entrance to a small cave. 1) 10m. Climb up out of the cave turning the large perched block on the right. 2) 30m. Move left into the groove proper up a series of ledges. Awkward moves follow as the groove begins to lean to the right. Easier rock leads to the top. **About 1.5 kilometres further north along the Coast Road there is a tiny cottage and a small pier. A tilted finger of rock, Saturn Pinnacle, on the slopes above has two routes.** **Violator** 18m VD M Curran, P Blake. 30/11/1969. Start at the back of the pinnacle. Gain the ledge and move right to the arête. Continue to the top. **The Savage** 35m VD F Mason. 1966 On the seaward side of the pinnacle climb straight up the slab, loose at the top. (Descent is by abseil). **Milky Way** 30m E2 5c M Daly, P McGarrity. 5/8/1995.
