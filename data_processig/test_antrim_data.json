Follow the corner to the top of the wall. =The Small Crag= The Small Crag is an edge 1km long and high above the north side of the scenic Murlough Bay. It is a continuation, though thinner, of the same dolerite sill which forms the Main Crag of Fair Head. The best approach for all routes is from the National Trust car park at the head of Murlough Bay. From here a path runs northwards along the cliff top towards Fair Head. The cliff line from the car park to the Main Crag can be very broadly divided into two shallow bays, each approximately a kilometre in length. The first bay is the Small Crag. It starts at the Backwoods Buttress, 150m north of the car park. It then sweeps below Lough Fadden before rising up to form a gentle crest. The crag is never more than 20m in height and is broken by several narrow gullies and weaknesses. Just beyond the crest are a wire fence and wooden stile, this marks the northerly limit of the Small Crag. The second bay continues northwards sweeping round to join the Main Crag at December. Here the cliff is higher than the Small Crag, but the rock is generally poorer and more vegetated. Consequently there are no routes in this second bay with the exception of one steep wall situated about 200m north of the wire fence. This has been imaginatively named the Middle Crag and has five routes, all recommended. The Small Crag has never had more than a handful of devotees. Whilst this is understandable due to the more compelling attractions of the Main Crag, it is unfortunate as the Small Crag offers some good and varied climbing. Steep technical cracks, delicate slabs, fine arêtes, walls and pinnacles can all be found. There is now a wide range of difficulty (up to 6b) and a variation in quality from the excellent to the atrocious. As the crag faces east, most of the routes catch the sun until early afternoon, and both climbers and midges are well sheltered from the prevailing winds. The ground below the crag is heavily wooded, especially south of Seeds of the Weeds and north of Morning. This makes approaching routes along the base of the cliff unpleasant, particularly in summer, after rain, or with a hangover. Generally it is better to approach from above, descending into the jungle at the last possible opportunity. Recommended descents for the different sections of crag have been given. Excepting a few of the slabby walls and arêtes, protection is generally adequate. Friends and small wires are useful. The routes have been described from south to north, that is left to right as you face the cliff. 150m along the cliff-top path from the Murlough Bay car park there is a gate and stile. Directly below this lies a small steep buttress known as Backwoods Buttress. It is set slightly in front of the main cliff line, is quick to dry and has three routes. From the gate walk 25m down the unmetalled track and the best descent is on your left."

Start at the bottom of two impressive cracks which run up the corner behind the lay-by. 1) 15m. Climb easily up the chimney, exit left and continue up to a restricted stance under a large overhang. 2) 30m. Move up and right past an old wedge to gain a vertical crack. Climb the corner on good holds, loose at the top. Finish up the grass. King Nose 40m S Start approximately half way between Cockleshell Cracks and El Condor in a vegetated corner left of a prominent arête. 1) 30m. Climb the right-hand pocketed wall on good holds before moving left into the corner. Move up and step left below a small tree. Step back right and gain the wide irregular crack. Follow this rightwards, exiting onto an airy platform on the arête. 2) 12m. Easily up mixed grass and rock to the top. Tort 56m S A rising traverse of the right-hand buttress, this route takes in some good scenery. Poor protection. Start at the base of the obvious groove at the left edge of the right-hand buttress. 1) 28m. Enter the corner and climb easily on large holds until it is possible to pull out right and traverse right below the overhanging wall to a sentry box belay in the middle of the buttress. 2) 28m. Continue the horizontal traverse across the right wall onto the arête. From this exposed position climb on poor rock to the top. Impending Disaster 42m VD + A2 An exposed route with fine situations. Start at the base of an inverted Y-crack, roughly in the middle of the buttress. 1) 20m. Begin up the wriggly crack and weave through the overhangs above to arrive at sentry box. 2) 22m. The impending wall on the left is split by a rising crack. Move out across this crack on pegs (some in place) to the edge where the crack assumes a near vertical tilt. Using thinner pegs move up this headwall to grass and a metal spike belay. El Condor 42m S 1) 20m. As for Impending Disaster. 2) 22m. Follow a steep ramp leading diagonally upwards to the right. Emerge onto the arête and follow it to the top. This crag lies about 500m north of the Coast Road Crag beside a side road running up to the nearby college. Most routes tend to be short and problematical, particularly those found on the seaward buttress. The three routes listed are on the landward side of the road close to the main wall.

The route follows a thin groove to a tiny stance on the arête at about 9m. Move left to gain the depression which is crossed on large flint bollards.

Easier rock leads to the top. About 1.5 kilometres further north along the Coast Road there is a tiny cottage and a small pier. A tilted finger of rock, Saturn Pinnacle, on the slopes above has two routes. Violator 18m VD Start at the back of the pinnacle. Gain the ledge and move right to the arête. Continue to the top.

Climb up out of the cave turning the large perched block on the right. 2) 30m. Move left into the groove proper up a series of ledges. Awkward moves follow as the groove begins to lean to the right. Easier rock leads to the top. About 1.5 kilometres further north along the Coast Road there is a tiny cottage and a small pier. A tilted finger of rock, Saturn Pinnacle, on the slopes above has two routes. Violator 18m VD Start at the back of the pinnacle. Gain the ledge and move right to the arête. Continue to the top. The Savage 35m VD On the seaward side of the pinnacle climb straight up the slab, loose at the top. (Descent is by abseil). Milky Way 30m E2 5c Behind Saturn Pinnacle there is a white wall with a crack running up the centre – the route takes this perfect jam crack."

            "description": "A rising traverse of the right-hand buttress, this route takes in some good scenery. Poor protection. Start at the base of the obvious groove at the left edge of the right-hand buttress. 1) 28m. Enter the corner and climb easily on large holds until it is possible to pull out right and traverse right below the overhanging wall to a sentry box belay in the middle of the buttress. 2) 28m. Continue the horizontal traverse across the right wall onto the arête. From this exposed position climb on poor rock to the top. Impending Disaster 42m VD + A2 An exposed route with fine situations. Start at the base of an inverted Y-crack, roughly in the middle of the buttress. 1) 20m. Begin up the wriggly crack and weave through the overhangs above to arrive at sentry box. 2) 22m. The impending wall on the left is split by a rising crack. Move out across this crack on pegs (some in place) to the edge where the crack assumes a near vertical tilt. Using thinner pegs move up this headwall to grass and a metal spike belay. El Condor 42m S 1) 20m. As for Impending Disaster. 2) 22m. Follow a steep ramp leading diagonally upwards to the right. Emerge onto the arête and follow it to the top. This crag lies about 500m north of the Coast Road Crag beside a side road running up to the nearby college. Most routes tend to be short and problematical, particularly those found on the seaward buttress. The three routes listed are on the landward side of the road close to the main wall. Descend towards a small cottage 100m to the south. == Descriptions for the following routes are out of date due to rock fall and they are considered dangerous == Coughin Wall 33m HS Serious with some loose rock at mid-height, not well protected. Start at the bottom of an ill-defined groove about 3m left of the shallow arête formed where the main wall meets the road. Locate a small overhang and climb directly up. At about 10m move slightly right to gain the depression above. Finish straight up. Ottago 33m S Start a few metres right of Coughin Wall at the left-hand side of the main wall. The route follows a thin groove to a tiny stance on the arête at about 9m. Move left to gain the depression which is crossed on large flint bollards. Straight up to the top and belay on the metal spike. Heckler 40m VS M Henry, M Curran (Alternate Lead). 1/6/72. A fine airy route with good protection throughout.
