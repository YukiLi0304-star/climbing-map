            "description": "The rock is dolerite, of columnar formation and dries quickly after rain. The routes are all one pitch, up to 30m in height and mostly follow crack lines offering good protection. Some of the easier routes contain loose rock and should be treated carefully. The roadside nature of the crag has its drawbacks, and the occupiers of the surrounding land, Ballygalley Golf Club, have withdrawn their permission for climbing to carry on. Their fears apparently stem from any liability they may have if climbers on their land cause any accident to road users. The MCI has been negotiating for some years now to improve the situation but the Golf Club are currently refusing to discuss the matter further. The MCI has asked that its members do nothing to further aggravate the situation and requests that any climbers exercise caution if climbing on the crag. The situation may well change and such changes will be published in Irish Mountain Log and on the MCI's website www.mountaineering.ie.and on fairheadclimbers.com There is a car parking area about 100m south of the crag – below the old quarry where climbing stopped many years ago to protect nesting seabirds. The crag is made up of two bays, containing Stable Gully and Castle Gully respectively, separated by the roadside wall. The main hazards to road users stem from stones being knocked down while descending Castle Gully, so it is best to avoid this and follow a small track down the northern side of the headland to reach the road about 50m north of the crag. If climbing at Ballygalley is to have any future then it will only be as a result of sensible use. Tapiola 10m VD Takes the clean crack, wall and arête left of WC. Pleasant climbing. WC 10m VD Takes the short crack at the extreme left-hand side of the cliff. Iky-Mo-MO 15m S 3c The twin cracks immediately right of WC, finishing either straight up or exiting right. Slipskid 28m E1 5c The arête between IKY-MO and Lucky Strike. Lucky Strike ** 28m VS 5a A fine delicate climb that takes the thin crack 3m below and left of IKY-MO. The route follows the crack directly with the grade easing after about half height. Reprisal * 28m VS 4b The next crack to the right and the wall to the right of this are climbed past a small notch to a good ledge. Easier climbing to the top. Sabre 30m S The thin crack, 1m right of Reprisal, is followed through a bulging overhang to the top. Astronaut 30m S It takes a line just right of Sabre to the large corner and straight up to the right hand end of \"sabre\" ledge The next ten routes have all become very grassy and a bit loose and are not recommended. Christmas 30m VD . Route takes a thin crack, left of a rib about 3m right of Astronaut, to reach the Oval and the top. - this route has fallen down Cutlass 30m VD Climb the crack, right of the rib, right to Cutlass to stand on a doubtful flake.

Pull Through 150m S A girdle traverse, starting as for Sputnik, moving left from a large grass bay along the obvious fault line to cross the arête of Slipskid into IKY-MO and finally WC. Quiet Times 12m. HVS 5b The crack left of Postie. Up Postie until flat handholds enable the crack to be gained. Strenuous moves up the crack gain another flat hold. Up to the ledge and belay. Either move left and up Sputnik or abseil off. Postie 30m HVS 5b The first crack on the left side of the left wall of Stable Gully. The crux is low down and short. From a small shelf left of the crack move out into the crack and up using holds on the left wall. Reach a big ledge known as the Hay Loft and easier ground to the top. Rupert Bear and Bright Red Wellies * 30m HVS 5b Takes the thin crack between Postie and Stable Gully. Sustained and difficult climbing to the Hay Loft ledge with easier ground above. Warm-up 30m VS 4b Start as for Stable Gully but take the crack in the left wall to gain the Hay Loft. Stable Gully 30m S A loose, nettly, brambly route – leaders should carry panga knives.

This area contains the best concentration of quality routes on the crag. Dire Straits * 30m E3 5c The left-hand arête of the bay. Up the arête to a flat-topped spike. A traverse into Vindication can be made to place runners. Hard moves on the arête lead to a shaky flake and peg runner. Hard laybacking gives access to an easier wall above. Vindication *** 30m E1 5b The left-most crack on the left gully wall, starting at the road. The crack slants to the right and becomes a diedre near the top. Climb the crack awkwardly to a small grass ledge at 15m. Move up the groove by wide bridging (for the tall) or chimneying. As the groove steepens, better holds materialise and the top section is best climbed facing left. Cat's Eyes * 30m VS 4c Start in a shallow recess a few metres right of Vindication.

Lunar Probe 25m VD The obvious arête on the right-hand side of the lay-by with some loose rock. Climb the undercut nose and up the arête. Step into the chimney on the right and continue up until it is possible to scramble right to the top. Germinal * 25m VS 4b Takes the crack line splitting the pillars to the left of Dirty Sox, with the crux at the overhang. Dirty Sox * 33m VS 4b Start 8m right of Lunar Probe at a crack rising from a small grassy bay. Follow the crack to the obvious bulge. Climb this and from a good ledge enter a groove and climb to the overhanging rock which is surmounted on the left. Silent Running * 25m HS Takes the corner immediately right of Dirty Sox. The belay at the top is a long way back. - overgrown Pocket 22m HVS 5a The second crack line right of Silent Running. Crux at about 15m. Blackballed * 25m E2 5c The first crack right of Pocket – thin and sustained climbing. Full Tilt Boogie Crack 25m HVS 5b The first crack left of Days of Heaven, starting on the same grassy ledge. Jam up the crack to an awkward stance below the overhang. Climb the overhang directly using delicate bridging. Days of Heaven * 25m HVS 5a - has become a bit loose The shallow fault immediately left of Illegal – gained by climbing the front of the big ledge recess. Illegal ** 25m HS 4b The right-hand end of the roadside wall is marked by a fine arête of rock that comes right down to road level. Dire Straits takes this arête and Illegal takes the crack line just to the left of it. Crux at 20m – now loose The second bay of rock enclosed by arêtes on either side with a loose gully in the upper right-hand side. This area contains the best concentration of quality routes on the crag. Dire Straits * 30m E3 5c The left-hand arête of the bay. Up the arête to a flat-topped spike. A traverse into Vindication can be made to place runners. Hard moves on the arête lead to a shaky flake and peg runner. Hard laybacking gives access to an easier wall above. Vindication *** 30m E1 5b The left-most crack on the left gully wall, starting at the road. The crack slants to the right and becomes a diedre near the top. Climb the crack awkwardly to a small grass ledge at 15m. Move up the groove by wide bridging (for the tall) or chimneying. As the groove steepens, better holds materialise and the top section is best climbed facing left. Cat's Eyes * 30m VS 4c Start in a shallow recess a few metres right of Vindication. Climb the corner crack until the angle eases. Move delicately up to the right across the wall to gain a parallel crack that runs down from the terminal overhang. Follow this with one awkward move to the top. Night Flight * 30m E1 5b Good wall climbing. Start at the thin crack just right of Cat's Eyes. Climb this moving right at the top. Deadline ** 30m HVS 5a Climbs the thin crack between Night Flight and Kleptomaniac, with the difficulties easing above half-height. Kleptomaniac ** 30m VS 4c Start about midway between Vindication and Castle Gully, at the right-hand end of the road facing the wall. Climb the obvious crack with the crux being the bulge near the top. These Foolish Things 30m HVS 5a Takes the thin crack starting high on the wall between Kleptomaniac and Star Spangled Banner, eliminate Star Spangled Banner * 25m HVS 5a Follows the large, overhanging corner, on the left wall of Castle Gully. Clearway ** 25m E1 5b Takes the crack line starting 1m to the right of Star Spangled Banner and trending right to the top. Sustained and varied climbing. Chancery * 25m HS 4b This route takes the cracks on the left wall of Castle Gully, between Clearway and the gully itself. Climb the cracks to a ledge on the right. Move back left by a strenuous pull-up to easier ground. Singer 24m HVS 5b Start as for Chancery until a move can be made onto a large ledge on the right. Up a short wall behind this to another ledge and finally up a crack behind with increasing difficulty. There follows Castle Gully, nasty, muddy and loose. Fina 30m VD Opposite Chancery on the right-hand gully wall this climb takes the broken corner left of Equity. loose and dangerous Equity 20m S The obvious deep crack culminating in the overhang near the top of the left-hand gully wall. Straightforward climbing leads to the overhang which is awkwardly surmounted on good holds. loose and dangerous Harry *** 25m VS 4c A McQuoid (First free ascent). The left-hand of two parallel leftward-trending cracks about half-way down the gully wall. Begins easily but gradually becomes more technical leaving the crux to the last few moves. Debbie ** 27m VS 4c The right-hand of the two cracks. Follow the crack to small overhang which is climbed directly. Continue up the corner enjoying the protection. Dodgems 28m HS 4a The right-hand arête of the Castle Gully area. Start on the gully wall just right of Debbie, gain the arête and follow it to the top with minimal protection. Close to the Edge 28m HVS 5b A direct start to Dodgems starting from the road at the foot of the arête. Roadside Attraction * 21m HVS 5a The first crack right of Close to the Edge joining the arête at half-height. Mister Guilty * 21m HVS 5a The crack immediately right of Roadside Attraction. Follow the crack until it closes at half-height. Move slightly right and up an easier-angled section. Pull back left onto the ledge and follow the grass ledges to the top. Nokey's Arête 20m HVS 5a 7m to the right of Mister Guilty there is a steel post. Start 5m right of this at a prominent corner. Climb a slabby wall immediately right of the corner until it is possible to step right onto good footholds on the arête. Climb directly to the top."

Follow the corner to the top of the wall. =The Small Crag= The Small Crag is an edge 1km long and high above the north side of the scenic Murlough Bay. It is a continuation, though thinner, of the same dolerite sill which forms the Main Crag of Fair Head. The best approach for all routes is from the National Trust car park at the head of Murlough Bay. From here a path runs northwards along the cliff top towards Fair Head. The cliff line from the car park to the Main Crag can be very broadly divided into two shallow bays, each approximately a kilometre in length. The first bay is the Small Crag. It starts at the Backwoods Buttress, 150m north of the car park. It then sweeps below Lough Fadden before rising up to form a gentle crest. The crag is never more than 20m in height and is broken by several narrow gullies and weaknesses. Just beyond the crest are a wire fence and wooden stile, this marks the northerly limit of the Small Crag. The second bay continues northwards sweeping round to join the Main Crag at December. Here the cliff is higher than the Small Crag, but the rock is generally poorer and more vegetated. Consequently there are no routes in this second bay with the exception of one steep wall situated about 200m north of the wire fence. This has been imaginatively named the Middle Crag and has five routes, all recommended. The Small Crag has never had more than a handful of devotees. Whilst this is understandable due to the more compelling attractions of the Main Crag, it is unfortunate as the Small Crag offers some good and varied climbing. Steep technical cracks, delicate slabs, fine arêtes, walls and pinnacles can all be found. There is now a wide range of difficulty (up to 6b) and a variation in quality from the excellent to the atrocious. As the crag faces east, most of the routes catch the sun until early afternoon, and both climbers and midges are well sheltered from the prevailing winds. The ground below the crag is heavily wooded, especially south of Seeds of the Weeds and north of Morning. This makes approaching routes along the base of the cliff unpleasant, particularly in summer, after rain, or with a hangover. Generally it is better to approach from above, descending into the jungle at the last possible opportunity. Recommended descents for the different sections of crag have been given. Excepting a few of the slabby walls and arêtes, protection is generally adequate. Friends and small wires are useful. The routes have been described from south to north, that is left to right as you face the cliff. 150m along the cliff-top path from the Murlough Bay car park there is a gate and stile. Directly below this lies a small steep buttress known as Backwoods Buttress. It is set slightly in front of the main cliff line, is quick to dry and has three routes. From the gate walk 25m down the unmetalled track and the best descent is on your left."

            "description": "=The Main Crag= <nowiki/>' The grey fortress of the Main Crag stands proud to a height of 100m for most of its four kilometre length. Walls and columns, prows and bays followed by more walls and more columns soon confuse the route finder, and the two descent gullies, being three kilometres apart, are of limited use as reference points. To simplify descriptions the headland has been split into ten sections, each with a brief introduction. Grey Man's Path is the impressive gully bridged by a huge fallen column which gives access to the first four areas - Binnagapple, Grey Man's Path, the White Lightning Amphitheatre and the Bird Hide Block area. This part of the cliff is usually approached from the car park at the McBrides' farm but can also be approached from the National Trust car park at Coolanlough; follow the National Trust marked path to the gully. Alternatively follow the cliff top path (also marked) from the first car park above Murlough Bay. It is also possible to walk into Binnagapple from the miners' track which runs in from the second car park, below the Small Crag. Crack climbing predominates all along the crag but in recent years the walls have yielded some fine face routes. As long as these steep walls, arêtes and little blind grooves are being explored the new routes will continue to appear. The edge of the cliff is higher than the moorland behind and drainage is excellent, making Fair Head a good winter option. The prevailing westerly winds can be unpleasant at times but as the headland is actually the north-eastern corner of Ireland, it is usually not difficult to find a more sheltered area. As it faces mainly north it's worth remembering which parts of the crag get the sun - Binnagapple, Ballycastle Descent Gully East, The Prow and Marconi's Cove being the best. ==Binnagapple Area== This is the leftmost part of the Main Crag. It is bounded on the left by an extensive vegetated area (the start of the sound rock is marked by a jumble of huge boulders) and runs as far as the area around Grey Man's Path. A broken stone wall runs to the face as one nears the end of this part of the cliff coming from the gully. Some routes are described in relation to this wall. The rock here is clean and lichen free, as it gets the early morning sun, and there is a good selection of three star routes."

Whilst this is understandable due to the more compelling attractions of the Main Crag, it is unfortunate as the Small Crag offers some good and varied climbing. Steep technical cracks, delicate slabs, fine arêtes, walls and pinnacles can all be found. There is now a wide range of difficulty (up to 6b) and a variation in quality from the excellent to the atrocious. As the crag faces east, most of the routes catch the sun until early afternoon, and both climbers and midges are well sheltered from the prevailing winds. The ground below the crag is heavily wooded, especially south of Seeds of the Weeds and north of Morning. This makes approaching routes along the base of the cliff unpleasant, particularly in summer, after rain, or with a hangover. Generally it is better to approach from above, descending into the jungle at the last possible opportunity. Recommended descents for the different sections of crag have been given. Excepting a few of the slabby walls and arêtes, protection is generally adequate. Friends and small wires are useful. The routes have been described from south to north, that is left to right as you face the cliff. 150m along the cliff-top path from the Murlough Bay car park there is a gate and stile. Directly below this lies a small steep buttress known as Backwoods Buttress. It is set slightly in front of the main cliff line, is quick to dry and has three routes. From the gate walk 25m down the unmetalled track and the best descent is on your left."

It tends to be a bit windy and sunless and the walls are slow to dry, with the result that it has never been very popular despite the easy access. It does have some excellent routes however, including Burn Up, and an early classic, Night Rider, which weaves a fine line through a band of formidable overhangs."

Continue up the wide crack above (easy but strenuous) passing an overhang to a small niche and belay. 3) 10m (5a). Chimney up the niche and swing out on good holds then up and left on a ledge. Move back right and up a blocky crack to the top. ==White Lightning Amphitheatre== Beyond Thran a huge amphitheatre comes into view. The climbs in this area are best approached by abseil. The terrain at the foot of the cliff is very rough and needs to be traversed with care as many of the big holes between the huge boulders are hidden beneath vegetation. The crag takes a turn and forms a right-facing corner with a vegetated gully. Infidel climbs the left wall of this gully."

As long as these steep walls, arêtes and little blind grooves are being explored the new routes will continue to appear. The edge of the cliff is higher than the moorland behind and drainage is excellent, making Fair Head a good winter option. The prevailing westerly winds can be unpleasant at times but as the headland is actually the north-eastern corner of Ireland, it is usually not difficult to find a more sheltered area. As it faces mainly north it's worth remembering which parts of the crag get the sun - Binnagapple, Ballycastle Descent Gully East, The Prow and Marconi's Cove being the best. ==Binnagapple Area== This is the leftmost part of the Main Crag. It is bounded on the left by an extensive vegetated area (the start of the sound rock is marked by a jumble of huge boulders) and runs as far as the area around Grey Man's Path. A broken stone wall runs to the face as one nears the end of this part of the cliff coming from the gully. Some routes are described in relation to this wall.

Follow the corner to the top of the wall. =The Small Crag= The Small Crag is an edge 1km long and high above the north side of the scenic Murlough Bay. It is a continuation, though thinner, of the same dolerite sill which forms the Main Crag of Fair Head. The best approach for all routes is from the National Trust car park at the head of Murlough Bay. From here a path runs northwards along the cliff top towards Fair Head. The cliff line from the car park to the Main Crag can be very broadly divided into two shallow bays, each approximately a kilometre in length. The first bay is the Small Crag. It starts at the Backwoods Buttress, 150m north of the car park. It then sweeps below Lough Fadden before rising up to form a gentle crest. The crag is never more than 20m in height and is broken by several narrow gullies and weaknesses. Just beyond the crest are a wire fence and wooden stile, this marks the northerly limit of the Small Crag. The second bay continues northwards sweeping round to join the Main Crag at December. Here the cliff is higher than the Small Crag, but the rock is generally poorer and more vegetated. Consequently there are no routes in this second bay with the exception of one steep wall situated about 200m north of the wire fence. This has been imaginatively named the Middle Crag and has five routes, all recommended. The Small Crag has never had more than a handful of devotees. Whilst this is understandable due to the more compelling attractions of the Main Crag, it is unfortunate as the Small Crag offers some good and varied climbing. Steep technical cracks, delicate slabs, fine arêtes, walls and pinnacles can all be found. There is now a wide range of difficulty (up to 6b) and a variation in quality from the excellent to the atrocious. As the crag faces east, most of the routes catch the sun until early afternoon, and both climbers and midges are well sheltered from the prevailing winds. The ground below the crag is heavily wooded, especially south of Seeds of the Weeds and north of Morning. This makes approaching routes along the base of the cliff unpleasant, particularly in summer, after rain, or with a hangover. Generally it is better to approach from above, descending into the jungle at the last possible opportunity. Recommended descents for the different sections of crag have been given. Excepting a few of the slabby walls and arêtes, protection is generally adequate. Friends and small wires are useful. The routes have been described from south to north, that is left to right as you face the cliff. 150m along the cliff-top path from the Murlough Bay car park there is a gate and stile. Directly below this lies a small steep buttress known as Backwoods Buttress. It is set slightly in front of the main cliff line, is quick to dry and has three routes. From the gate walk 25m down the unmetalled track and the best descent is on your left."

            "description": "A very well protected route hosting a moderate mix of cracks and face climbing with memorable belay stations. The route begins in a niche with a short vertical finger crack to the left of two stacked blocks, about 10m left and up from The X-men. The line follows a fairly direct line up an open corner/crack system, just right of the large roof at 60m. The line can be reached easily from the Runda Ab-in, using directionals to keep to climbers left. 1) 30m (5a). Climb the finger crack left of the block or straight up the short slab of the stacked blocks to reach the top of the two stacked blocks. This gains access to the amazing double crack in the alcove between columns. Climb the splitter double cracks ranging from 1-10cm with fun stemming behind. When level with the top of the pillar on the right, step right to gain the top of the pillar that serves as the first pitch belay on a throne. Build an anchor on climber’s right or sling the throne. 2) 20m (5c). From the throne belay, step back left into the main crack system and climb sustained vertical cracks and face for 20m before belaying on a small obvious ledge on climber’s left. Large cams are useful for anchor. 3) 25m (6a). Continue up the steep crack system above with an early crux which takes small wires. Continue with good protection for 20m then step right to join Runda for a few metres and build an anchor on another great belay ledge at the base of a double crack system created by a massive flake. 4) 15m (5a) Head directly straight up, leaving Runda, up the double crack system to the top of the flake which gains a vertical crack and a memorable top out."

            "description": "The usual approach to this area is by abseil but it can be reached in about thirty-five minutes from the Ballycastle Descent Gully. From the bottom of the gully turn right (east) and follow a faint path which rises a little under the wall of the huge overhangs (Wall of Prey) and turns a large boulder beneath the big corner of Equinox. At this point a stretch of cliff, Rathlin Wall, comes into view bounded in the distance by the headwall of Cúchulainn. The path rises noticeably below Cúchulainn as it crosses a grassy col and passes between a huge boulder and the main face. Just beyond the col the lower part of the face gives way to some broken heathery ledges which mark the start of the Terraces. This is a short section and it ends at the large prow high on the cliff a little further on. The path, what's left of it, disappears at this point as the wild goats are no longer around to maintain it. Beyond the prow lies a very long stretch of cliff in the first half of which there are as yet no routes. About 150m beyond the prow the ground rise slightly and more of the cliff comes into view. At this point there is a 10m high tooth of rock in front of the crag - a fairly humble feature in itself, but in an area with an array of uniform columns it has had greatness thrust upon it. It is known as the Fang and many routes are described in relation to it. About 150m left of the Fang there is another landmark - An Bealach Runda itself - a huge detached pillar topped by a large flake which leans against the cliff face at half height, clearly visible from a distance. A 90m abseil down An Gobán Saor deposits you perfectly for the next 3 routes."

Pull left to a comfortable belay below a small flake overhang. 2) 50m (5c). Directly above the belay, surmount the flake on its left (crux). Follow the narrow slab above to the roof which is climbed using the crack on its left side and a jammed block on the lip. Continue up the groove system, passing another overhang, to the top."

Move delicately across these and step down to a lower ledge (crux). Continue across to a short groove. Climb this (hard) and up more easily to the belay of Drag Race Queen. 3) 30m (5b). Move left to an obvious ledge. Continue left across the groove and narrow ledges to a ledge above an obvious flake. Step left and finish up as for The Vandals. Situated on the wall left of Bates's Motel is a huge overhang. On the head wall there are three crack lines and the following routes climb these. Abseil down to a semi-hanging belay on a small ledge just at the lip of the overhang. This is the belay for these routes (wires and small friends required for belay). Soul Shaker ** 25m E6 (6c) Good climbing with even better pendulum potential. Climb Fired Earth to the niche above the pegs (purple cam). Using a good sidepull and poor footholds, float leftwards to gain a hidden flat jug (crux). Continue up the excellent well protected thin crack above to the top. Watch out for the sting in the tail!"

The rock is a type of chalk containing large flints which form sharp holds. Above the chalk there is a tilted layer of weathered basalt which forms the bulk of the headland proper and is of no climbing interest. The routes can be quite loose, particularly at the top, and care must be taken not to dislodge rocks onto the road. Climbers have hitherto been active here with the tacit permission of the owners at the nearby college. Cars may be parked in the public car park adjacent to the post office, about 30m from the crag. Descent from the routes is by the large grassy gullies at either side of the crag. Moratorium 40m HS A large buttress on the left of the crag encroaches on the road. The route which starts in a sheltered alcove winds its way round the buttress from bottom left to top right. After a difficult start move around the corner (right) to gain a steep groove. Continue up past ivy and loose rock to belay on a post. Cockleshell Cracks 45m HS The best route on the crag. Start at the bottom of two impressive cracks which run up the corner behind the lay-by. 1) 15m. Climb easily up the chimney, exit left and continue up to a restricted stance under a large overhang. 2) 30m. Move up and right past an old wedge to gain a vertical crack. Climb the corner on good holds, loose at the top. Finish up the grass. King Nose 40m S Start approximately half way between Cockleshell Cracks and El Condor in a vegetated corner left of a prominent arête. 1) 30m. Climb the right-hand pocketed wall on good holds before moving left into the corner. Move up and step left below a small tree. Step back right and gain the wide irregular crack. Follow this rightwards, exiting onto an airy platform on the arête. 2) 12m. Easily up mixed grass and rock to the top. Tort 56m S A rising traverse of the right-hand buttress, this route takes in some good scenery. Poor protection. Start at the base of the obvious groove at the left edge of the right-hand buttress. 1) 28m. Enter the corner and climb easily on large holds until it is possible to pull out right and traverse right below the overhanging wall to a sentry box belay in the middle of the buttress. 2) 28m. Continue the horizontal traverse across the right wall onto the arête. From this exposed position climb on poor rock to the top. Impending Disaster 42m VD + A2 An exposed route with fine situations. Start at the base of an inverted Y-crack, roughly in the middle of the buttress. 1) 20m. Begin up the wriggly crack and weave through the overhangs above to arrive at sentry box. 2) 22m. The impending wall on the left is split by a rising crack. Move out across this crack on pegs (some in place) to the edge where the crack assumes a near vertical tilt. Using thinner pegs move up this headwall to grass and a metal spike belay. El Condor 42m S 1) 20m. As for Impending Disaster. 2) 22m. Follow a steep ramp leading diagonally upwards to the right. Emerge onto the arête and follow it to the top. This crag lies about 500m north of the Coast Road Crag beside a side road running up to the nearby college. Most routes tend to be short and problematical, particularly those found on the seaward buttress. The three routes listed are on the landward side of the road close to the main wall. Descend towards a small cottage 100m to the south. == Descriptions for the following routes are out of date due to rock fall and they are considered dangerous == Coughin Wall 33m HS Serious with some loose rock at mid-height, not well protected. Start at the bottom of an ill-defined groove about 3m left of the shallow arête formed where the main wall meets the road. Locate a small overhang and climb directly up. At about 10m move slightly right to gain the depression above. Finish straight up. Ottago 33m S Start a few metres right of Coughin Wall at the left-hand side of the main wall. The route follows a thin groove to a tiny stance on the arête at about 9m. Move left to gain the depression which is crossed on large flint bollards. Straight up to the top and belay on the metal spike. Heckler 40m VS M Henry, M Curran (Alternate Lead). 1/6/72. A fine airy route with good protection throughout. The line follows the prominent groove on the right-hand side of the main wall. Start at the entrance to a small cave. 1) 10m. Climb up out of the cave turning the large perched block on the right. 2) 30m. Move left into the groove proper up a series of ledges. Awkward moves follow as the groove begins to lean to the right. Easier rock leads to the top. About 1.5 kilometres further north along the Coast Road there is a tiny cottage and a small pier. A tilted finger of rock, Saturn Pinnacle, on the slopes above has two routes. Violator 18m VD Start at the back of the pinnacle. Gain the ledge and move right to the arête. Continue to the top. The Savage 35m VD On the seaward side of the pinnacle climb straight up the slab, loose at the top. (Descent is by abseil).

            "description": "A large buttress on the left of the crag encroaches on the road. The route which starts in a sheltered alcove winds its way round the buttress from bottom left to top right. After a difficult start move around the corner (right) to gain a steep groove. Continue up past ivy and loose rock to belay on a post. Cockleshell Cracks 45m HS The best route on the crag. Start at the bottom of two impressive cracks which run up the corner behind the lay-by. 1) 15m. Climb easily up the chimney, exit left and continue up to a restricted stance under a large overhang. 2) 30m. Move up and right past an old wedge to gain a vertical crack. Climb the corner on good holds, loose at the top. Finish up the grass. King Nose 40m S Start approximately half way between Cockleshell Cracks and El Condor in a vegetated corner left of a prominent arête. 1) 30m. Climb the right-hand pocketed wall on good holds before moving left into the corner. Move up and step left below a small tree. Step back right and gain the wide irregular crack. Follow this rightwards, exiting onto an airy platform on the arête. 2) 12m. Easily up mixed grass and rock to the top. Tort 56m S A rising traverse of the right-hand buttress, this route takes in some good scenery. Poor protection. Start at the base of the obvious groove at the left edge of the right-hand buttress. 1) 28m. Enter the corner and climb easily on large holds until it is possible to pull out right and traverse right below the overhanging wall to a sentry box belay in the middle of the buttress. 2) 28m. Continue the horizontal traverse across the right wall onto the arête. From this exposed position climb on poor rock to the top. Impending Disaster 42m VD + A2 An exposed route with fine situations. Start at the base of an inverted Y-crack, roughly in the middle of the buttress. 1) 20m. Begin up the wriggly crack and weave through the overhangs above to arrive at sentry box. 2) 22m. The impending wall on the left is split by a rising crack. Move out across this crack on pegs (some in place) to the edge where the crack assumes a near vertical tilt. Using thinner pegs move up this headwall to grass and a metal spike belay. El Condor 42m S 1) 20m. As for Impending Disaster. 2) 22m. Follow a steep ramp leading diagonally upwards to the right. Emerge onto the arête and follow it to the top. This crag lies about 500m north of the Coast Road Crag beside a side road running up to the nearby college. Most routes tend to be short and problematical, particularly those found on the seaward buttress. The three routes listed are on the landward side of the road close to the main wall. Descend towards a small cottage 100m to the south. == Descriptions for the following routes are out of date due to rock fall and they are considered dangerous == Coughin Wall 33m HS Serious with some loose rock at mid-height, not well protected. Start at the bottom of an ill-defined groove about 3m left of the shallow arête formed where the main wall meets the road. Locate a small overhang and climb directly up. At about 10m move slightly right to gain the depression above. Finish straight up. Ottago 33m S Start a few metres right of Coughin Wall at the left-hand side of the main wall. The route follows a thin groove to a tiny stance on the arête at about 9m. Move left to gain the depression which is crossed on large flint bollards. Straight up to the top and belay on the metal spike. Heckler 40m VS M Henry, M Curran (Alternate Lead). 1/6/72. A fine airy route with good protection throughout. The line follows the prominent groove on the right-hand side of the main wall. Start at the entrance to a small cave. 1) 10m. Climb up out of the cave turning the large perched block on the right. 2) 30m. Move left into the groove proper up a series of ledges. Awkward moves follow as the groove begins to lean to the right. Easier rock leads to the top. About 1.5 kilometres further north along the Coast Road there is a tiny cottage and a small pier. A tilted finger of rock, Saturn Pinnacle, on the slopes above has two routes. Violator 18m VD Start at the back of the pinnacle. Gain the ledge and move right to the arête. Continue to the top. The Savage 35m VD On the seaward side of the pinnacle climb straight up the slab, loose at the top. (Descent is by abseil). Milky Way 30m E2 5c Behind Saturn Pinnacle there is a white wall with a crack running up the centre – the route takes this perfect jam crack."
